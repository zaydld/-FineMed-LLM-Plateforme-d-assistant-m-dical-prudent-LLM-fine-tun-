Glossary
Community health workers: Health workers who live in the communities they serve and typically have 
lower levels of formal education and training than professional health workers, such as nurses and doctors. 
Community health workers provide health education and referrals for a wide range of services, and support 
individuals, families and communities in preventive health measures and accessing appropriate curative 
and social services. They act as a bridge between providers of health, social and community services and 
communities that may have difficulty in accessing these services. Related terms include lay health worker and 
peer health worker.
Decentralization: The delivery of services at peripheral health facilities, community-based venues and 
locations beyond hospital settings or conventional health care sites, bringing care closer to people’s homes.
Digital health: The development and use of digital technologies to improve health. This broad term includes 
areas such as e-health (electronic health), m-health (mobile health), telemedicine, health information 
technology, wearable devices and artificial intelligence.
Health care specialists: Health workers who have obtained advanced degrees or formal qualifications 
following completion of further study beyond their initial health qualification. 
Health practitioners: Health workers who have acquired health-related qualifications, including both health 
professionals and health associate professionals.
Health workers: All people primarily engaged in activities intended to improve health.
Integration: The management and delivery of health services in a way that ensures people receive a 
continuum of health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment, according to their needs 
throughout the life course.
Self-care: The ability of individuals, families and communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain 
health and cope with illness and disability, with or without the support of a health worker.
Task sharing: The rational redistribution of responsibilities among health workforce teams. Specific 
tasks or roles are shared, where appropriate, with less specialized health workers to make more efficient 
use of available personnel. Task sharing should be accompanied by appropriate education, supervision, 
management support, licensing, regulation and remuneration.
ix
The global burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is high, with over 30 pathogens, including bacteria, 
viruses and parasites, known to be transmitted through sexual contact. WHO estimates that in 2020, there 
were 374 million new cases of curable STIs among people 15–49 years old. This included 156 million new cases 
of trichomoniasis, 128.5 million new cases of chlamydia, 82.4 million new cases of gonorrhoea and 7.1 million 
new cases of syphilis, amounting to approximately 1 million new curable STI cases every day. In 2022, the 
number of new syphilis cases had increased to 8.0 million.1 
WHO set ambitious targets in the global health sector strategy for HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs. By 2030, the 
strategy aims to reduce gonorrhoea and syphilis infections by 90% and eliminate congenital syphilis as a 
public health problem. To achieve these goals, the strategy emphasizes the need to improve access to STI 
prevention, screening, diagnostic and treatment services. 
These guidelines promote the delivery of people-centred health services for STIs by providing evidence-
based recommendations related to decentralization, integration, task sharing and digital health. These 
recommendations complement existing WHO guidelines for STI testing, treatment and management, 
and other service delivery interventions, such as self-care interventions. All the recommendations will be 
incorporated into the forthcoming WHO consolidated guidelines on STI prevention and care.
These guidelines aim to support countries and national programmes in developing national STI guidelines 
aligned with the 2030 global health sector strategy targets. They are intended for policy-makers, programme 
managers, health workers and other public health professionals involved in planning or implementing STI 
services, whether standalone or integrated with other health services. The guidelines also serve as a resource 
for donor and development agencies, international and nongovernmental organizations, civil society and 
community-based groups, especially those working with, or led by, key populations and the communities 
most affected by STIs, including HIV.
The development of these guidelines followed the methods outlined in the 2014 WHO handbook for guideline 
development. Overviews of reviews and WHO guidelines were conducted to address the guideline objectives. 
The Guideline Development Group reviewed the evidence and made recommendations, using the Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the evidence and 
formulate the recommendations. The External Review Group reviewed the guidelines before submission to the 
WHO Guidelines Review Committee.
Executive summary

Executive summary
Summary of recommendations
These guidelines provide evidence-informed recommendations for the delivery of STI services (Table 1). 
They support the implementation of other WHO recommendations on STI prevention and care, including the 
management of people presenting with STI symptoms, the screening of certain asymptomatic populations, 
and the treatment of individuals with confirmed STIs along with their sexual partners.
These recommendations are based on the following overarching guiding principle:
Health systems should be structured and strengthened to deliver quality-assured, accessible, 
equitable and people-centred services for the prevention, screening, diagnosis and 
management of sexually transmitted infections. 
Decision-makers should consider local and regional health system capacity, resources and population 
needs when selecting interventions to deliver these services.

Decentralization
WHO suggests the decentralization of services to improve access 
to prevention, screening, diagnosis and management of sexually 
transmitted infections.
Remarks: Decentralization means that quality-assured sexually 
transmitted infection services are provided beyond centralized 
health care facilities to meet the needs of people (for example, 
in primary care, peripheral or community-based health facilities, 
through outreach services or self-care interventions) and may 
involve referral to other sexually transmitted infection services. 
The addition of services should complement rather than replace 
centralized services.

Integration
WHO suggests the integration of services for prevention, 
screening, diagnosis and management of sexually transmitted 
infections into other health services, where relevant and 
feasible.
Remarks: Integration of sexually transmitted infection services 
should be prioritized in primary health care, HIV services, maternal 
health care, adolescent health, contraceptive/family planning 
services and other sexual and reproductive health services.
Conditional recommendation, 
low certainty in evidence of

Task sharing
WHO suggests that trained health practitioners can provide 
sexually transmitted infection services, and that community 
health workers can assist with service provision.
Remarks: Quality assurance mechanisms, regular standardized 
training, supportive supervision and mentoring systems should be in 
place to ensure the provision of quality-assured services. 
Conditional recommendation, 
low certainty in evidence of

Recommendations on the delivery of health services for the prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections
1.1 Epidemiology and global targets
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a major public health problem worldwide, reducing quality of life 
and causing serious morbidity and mortality. STIs directly impact reproductive and child health by causing 
infertility, cancers and pregnancy complications, including fetal and newborn infections, and facilitate sexual 
transmission of HIV. 
In addition, STIs affect national economies and individual finances, as they primarily affect people of working 
age, who may be unable to work due to infection.
The global burden of STIs remains high. In 2020, WHO estimated that there were approximately 374 million 
new infections of four curable STIs among people aged 15–49 years, including Chlamydia trachomatis (129 
million), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (82 million), Treponema pallidum or syphilis (7.1 million) and Trichomonas 
vaginalis (156 million) (1). In 2022, WHO estimated 8 million new cases of syphilis and 700 000 new cases of 
congenital syphilis (2, 3). Viral STIs such as genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human papillomavirus 
(HPV) infection also remain widespread. A concerning trend is the emerging antimicrobial resistance of N. 
gonorrhoeae, which is challenging the control of gonorrhoea. 
Population groups that are at higher risk of acquiring STIs include sex workers and their clients, gay and 
bisexual men and other men who have sex with men, trans and gender diverse people, people who inject 
drugs, people in prisons, adolescents and young people, mobile populations and people affected by conflict 
and civil unrest (1).
WHO set ambitious targets in the 2022 publication Global health sector strategies on, respectively, HIV, viral 
hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections for the period 2022–2030, including a 90% reduction in both 
gonorrhoea and syphilis infections, and the elimination of congenital syphilis as a public health problem 
(defined as fewer than 50 cases per 100 000 live births) by 2030 (4). To achieve these targets, the strategy on 
STIs (Chapter 6 of the publication) highlights the importance of making it easier for people with STIs or at risk 
of STIs to access prevention, diagnostic, treatment and care services.
These targets will not be reached unless services 
become more accessible to the populations 
most in need. Service delivery approaches 
should endeavour to make quality-assured, 
non-stigmatizing, STI services accessible and 
acceptable; and to empower individuals to become 
active participants in promoting their own health.

Global targets will not be 
reached unless services 
become more accessible to the 
populations most in need

1.2 Rationale for new recommendations
To reduce STIs and prevent complications, delivering quality-assured STI services, including prevention, 
screening, diagnosis and treatment, is essential. Timely and effective treatment of STIs, ideally provided on 
the same day as the patient’s first contact with health care providers, is a crucial public health intervention 
that helps break the chain of infection transmission. Ensuring high-quality care, defined as being safe, 
effective, timely, equitable, and people-centred, is key to addressing the global burden of STIs. 
However, significant barriers hinder the delivery of such care. Many health care systems rely on specialized, 
often stand-alone services that limit access due to people’s distance from clinics, restricted operating hours, 
and long wait times. These obstacles are particularly acute in areas with high STI prevalence and limited 
health care resources. As a result, many people cannot receive comprehensive, people-centred services, 
leading to inefficiencies, duplication of efforts, loss to follow-up and missed opportunities to reduce STI 
transmission and complications.
To address these challenges, health care systems should adopt a more people-centred approach to STI care, 
ensuring that services are respectful of and responsive to the preferences, needs and values of individuals 
and communities. These guidelines aim to provide evidence-based service delivery recommendations to 
enhance access to care, improve service quality and provide equitable, people-centred STI services. These 
recommendations complement existing service delivery recommendations, including self-care interventions, 
and support the implementation of other recommendations related to STI prevention and care. 
1.3 Objectives
The objectives of these guidelines are:
• to provide evidence-informed recommendations for the delivery of STI services; and
• to support countries and national programmes in developing national STI guidelines in line with the 
2030 global sector strategy targets.
1.4 Target audience
These guidelines are intended for STI prevention and control programme managers at the national level, as 
well as health workers in primary, secondary and tertiary health care facilities involved in the treatment and 
management of people with STIs. The recommendations and guidance are also important for other health 
workers, including community and lay health workers, responsible for offering and providing STI services. 
These guidelines are relevant to implementers of STI services, including those in HIV, sexual and reproductive 
health (SRH) services and maternal and child health services. They are also applicable to non-governmental 
and community-based organizations, including those working with or led by key populations affected by HIV, 
as well as service providers and users of HIV prevention services, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for 
HIV. The guidelines support the planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of these services, and 
can also serve as an advocacy tool to secure the financial and human resources needed to deliver acceptable, 
adequate, affordable and equitable STI care for all who need it.
The recommendations are particularly important for people with, or at increased risk of acquiring, STIs 
including HIV. This includes people from key populations, those who use HIV PrEP , and other vulnerable 
groups such as pregnant women, adolescents, indigenous populations and migrants.
1. Introduction

Recommendations on the delivery of health services for the prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections
1.5 Guiding principles
The following principles have informed the development of these guidelines and should guide the 
implementation of the recommendations:
• These guidelines will contribute to the achievement of key global goals, including the Sustainable 
Development Goals, and relevant national-level goals and targets.
• The guidelines are based on a public health approach to scaling up the provision of recommended 
services and care for people with STIs, with the aim of reaching everyone, including vulnerable 
populations and key populations, with recommended interventions (in accordance with WHO 
guidelines).
• The adaptation and implementation of the guidelines should be accompanied by efforts to 
promote and protect the human rights of people receiving STI services, including preventing stigma 
and discrimination, promoting gender equity, and ensuring that the use of services is always 
voluntary and never mandatory or coerced.
• The implementation of the recommendations in these guidelines should be informed by the 
local context, including the epidemiology of STIs, the availability of resources and commodities 
for diagnosis and treatment of STIs, the capacity of the health system and the anticipated cost-
effectiveness of the various interventions.
• The adaptability built into these guidelines is intended to promote accessibility, acceptability, 
equity and effectiveness of STI services through public and private health care systems, including 
at community health centres and other primary care facilities providing services for STIs, such 
as clinics for maternal and child health, antenatal care, family planning and other SRH services. 
As such, these guidelines should form part of a broader package of service delivery approaches, 
including linkage to prevention, testing, treatment and care services.
• The guidelines provide direction for acceptable and effective STI services for populations that are 
especially vulnerable to or at higher risk of STIs, including those living with HIV infection, and aim 
to improve health outcomes at the population level.
• The guidelines follow the guiding principles of the WHO Essential Medicines List: preventing the 
emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance, parsimony, feasibility and alignment with the WHO 
List of Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine, including the WHO AWaRe (access, 
watch, reserve) antibiotic categorization (5, 6). 
1.6 Structure of the guidelines
These guidelines provide evidence-informed service delivery recommendations and are intended to become 
subsections of the forthcoming consolidated guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care 
of STIs. They also offer direction for countries developing national recommendations; however, national 
guidelines should take into account local prevalence, as well as health service capacity and resources.
The new recommendations for STI service delivery are presented in Chapter 3. Other existing 
recommendations related to STI service delivery are presented in Chapter 4, and implementation 
considerations for the delivery of STI services in Chapter 5. Web Annexes A–D present the evidence-to-decision 
framework for each of the four recommendations. Web Annex E summarizes the evidence and methods used 
to inform these recommendations.

Recommendations on the delivery of health services for the prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections
2.1 Overview
These guidelines were developed in accordance with procedures in the WHO handbook for guideline 
development (7). 
The Guideline Development Group, convened in 2020 and 2023, identified key questions about the delivery of 
services for STIs. An overview of systematic reviews and WHO recommendations for service delivery for STIs 
and other conditions was conducted. Evidence summaries were developed, and the evidence was assessed 
according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
The Guideline Development Group developed the recommendations by considering the certainty of evidence 
for the effects, the balance of desirable and undesirable effects, values and preferences, acceptability, 
feasibility and resource needs across a variety of settings. Information on each of these aspects was included 
in evidence-to-decision tables, which were shared in advance electronically via the GRADEpro application with 
the Guideline Development Group for their feedback and used in meetings to support the judgements of the 
Guideline Development Group to make recommendations. Consistent with previous WHO guidelines, these 
recommendations are based on a public health approach. 
The following sections provide further details on each aspect of the guideline development process.
 
2.2 Roles of groups involved in developing the guidelines
Five main groups were formed to guide and implement the guideline development process, coordinated by 
the WHO Secretariat. Each group played a specific role, as described below. Annex 1 lists the members of these 
groups and other contributors and their affiliations.
1. WHO Steering Committee. This group, which is responsible for the overall coordination of the 
guideline development process, was led by the Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually 
Transmitted Infections Programmes. Participants included staff from this department, as well 
as from the Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research, the Department of 
Surveillance, Prevention and Control and the Department of Access to Medicines and Health 
Products. The Steering Committee also included WHO technical staff members from all WHO 
regions.
2. Guideline Development Group. This group comprised non-United Nations/non-WHO experts, 
health professionals and representatives of groups most affected by the recommendations 
in the guidelines. The 40 members formulated the WHO recommendations, including any 
implementation considerations. They also reviewed and approved the final content of these 
guidelines. The composition of the represented all six WHO regions and was balanced across 
gender and backgrounds, including academia and research, programme implementation 
and policy and community organizations and networks. The group members were selected in 
coordination with the WHO Steering Committee and WHO country and regional offices. The 
Steering Committee reviewed curricula vitae, declarations of interests and confidentiality 
agreements. The proposed membership list was posted for public review and comment, and then 
finalized.
3. External Review Group. This group was responsible for peer reviewing these guidelines, 
including the recommendations. The members were selected in consultation with the WHO 
Steering Committee to ensure geographical and gender balance. It comprised 14 peer reviewers 
from academia, policy and research institutions, programme implementation and community 
organizations and representatives of networks of key populations.
2. Methods

4. External evidence reviewers led by a methodologist. This team conducted the overview of the 
systematic reviews of the effects of interventions based on the selected key questions and of the 
WHO recommendations (and evidence in those recommendations). In addition, evidence on values 
and preferences, feasibility and cost-effectiveness was compiled and summarized for each question.
5. External observers. Representatives of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 
(ECDC) and the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP) attended the 
Guideline Development Group meeting as observers. Both organizations have a long-standing history 
of collaboration with WHO’s Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections 
Programmes. 
 
2.3 Managing conflicts of interest
Managing conflicts of interest was a priority. WHO’s procedures for the declaration of interests by experts were 
followed. Declarations of interest were obtained from all members of the Guideline Development Group, the 
External Review Group and other non-WHO participants involved in meetings and other guideline development 
processes, prior to assuming their roles. At the beginning of the Guideline Development Group meetings, including 
subgroup meetings, members disclosed any previously declared interests as well as any new ones.  
Ten members of the Guideline Development Group declared interests. All declarations were reviewed by WHO, and 
no conflicts of interest were identified that would preclude any member from participating fully in the guideline 
development process. A full compilation and summary of declarations of interest in provided in Annex 2. 
2.4 Scope and questions
In December 2013, the first Guideline Development Group meeting was held to agree on the scope of the STI 
guidelines and to identify the different phases for developing the various components of the guidelines. In 
December 2020, the Guideline Development Group met to define the framework for questions related to the 
delivery of STI services, using a general PICO question2 to guide the formulation of recommendations: “Should we 
recommend [strategy] to improve coverage, access and uptake of screening, diagnosis and management strategies 
for STIs?” . The populations and interventions were initially broad and were further refined with the results of a 
literature review and discussed with a smaller working group of the Guideline Development Group in December 
2023. Finally, the Guideline Development Group agreed to address the four interventions outlined in Table 2.1.

Recommendations on the delivery of health services for the prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections
2.5 Evidence to inform the guidelines
Discussions with the smaller working group of the Guideline Development Group determined that there are 
large systematic reviews of service delivery interventions in other WHO guidelines for other conditions (for 
example, hepatitis B and C and HIV). The Guideline Development Group agreed that these reviews could be 
used to inform the recommendation questions as direct or indirect evidence for benefits and harms, as well 
as for values and preferences, acceptability, equity, resources and feasibility. The Guideline Development 
Group agreed that in some cases, the evidence from those reviews could be rated down for serious concern 
or very serious concern with indirectness because the reviews were not in populations with STIs (but were 
in populations with infections where sexual transmission occurs and/or in similar key populations). It was 
also agreed that it may be possible not to rate that evidence down for indirectness. In discussions, it was 
pointed out that there are numerous systematic reviews for service delivery interventions in STI services. 
Although these reviews would not be as extensive as those for other conditions, they could still be used to 
inform decisions about the applicability of the effects from other reviews. For example, if the STI reviews 
found similar results to those for other conditions, the latter could be considered direct evidence (and not 
rated down for indirectness). In addition, the smaller working group discussed whether conducting systematic 
reviews of primary studies would be valuable. However, the group agreed that these reviews would likely not 
add to or provide a higher level of certainty of the evidence from the larger reviews of other conditions. The 
WHO Steering Group reviewed this approach to using evidence from other conditions and agreed.
Therefore, we conducted a search of the Epistemonikos database and Cochrane Library for reviews published 
from 2015 to August 2024 in English. We also searched for published WHO guidelines that addressed service 
delivery interventions for other conditions (see Web Annex E). The results from the relevant published 
systematic reviews and reviews from the WHO guidelines were summarized and presented in evidence-
to-decision frameworks. Evidence was also summarized for the effects of the interventions (based on the 
prioritized outcomes) and acceptability, feasibility, resources and equity indicators.  
As service delivery interventions can be context-specific, we abstracted data from the reviews of STI 
interventions about context and implementation. However, there was little contextual information in the 
reviews or in the primary studies included in those reviews. Therefore, the smaller working group determined 
that additional critical information was needed about the applicability of the reviews to STI service delivery 
and about the context when implementing service delivery interventions. The group agreed that this 
information should be obtained from the Guideline Development Group. We therefore circulated the draft 
evidence-to-decision tables to the Guideline Development Group via the GRADEpro application to obtain 
feedback in August 2024. We asked for the Guideline Development Group’s agreement or disagreement about 
preliminary judgements regarding the size of effects of the service delivery intervention, the probability 
of other criteria (such as feasibility), and for contextual considerations and how interventions are applied 
specifically in STIs. 
2.6 Assessment and presentation of the evidence
The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE approach and based on the 
domains for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias, effect size, dose response 
and opposing confounding (7, 8). When using evidence from published systematic reviews or reviews in WHO 
guidelines, the GRADE assessment from the source systematic reviews was abstracted. In some reviews, the 
GRADE assessment was provided for each outcome with details. However, in some source guidelines, the 
results of the GRADE assessment were provided narratively. When reviews were from WHO guidelines and 
conducted following WHO methodology, we did not reassess the GRADE assessment (with the exception of the 
domain of indirectness).
Certainty of the evidence for effects was assigned to one of the four grades of evidence defined by the GRADE 
Working Group:
• High certainty: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the 
effect.
• Moderate certainty: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be 
close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
9
2. Methods
• Low certainty: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially 
different from the estimate of the effect.
• Very low certainty: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be 
substantially different from the estimate of effect.
Confidence in the evidence for outcomes based on qualitative research was assessed using the GRADE-
CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research) approach, with four levels: high, 
moderate, low and very low confidence (7).
When a summary-of-findings table (also called an evidence profile) was available, it was used, and if not, a 
table was created. In most systematic reviews of the literature a meta-analysis could not be performed, but 
a synthesis of the evidence without meta-analysis was conducted. We provide the results quantitatively in 
the summary-of-findings table when meta-analysis was possible, but narratively when meta-analysis was 
not possible. Evidence-to-decision frameworks (that is, tables to facilitate decision-making for the updated 
recommendations) were drafted in advance of the Guideline Development Group meeting using the GRADEpro 
software (9) (see Web Annexes A–D for the evidence-to-decision framework for each recommendation).
2.7 Making recommendations
In September 2024, the Guideline Development Group met to make recommendations. It had reviewed 
the feedback obtained via GRADEpro in August 2024 and the updated evidence-to-decision tables to make 
judgements about the effects of the interventions and the strength of the recommendation for or against 
the intervention. The Guideline Development Group agreed by consensus and there were no disagreements 
requiring voting.
According to the GRADE approach, the strength of the recommendations reflects the degree of confidence of 
the Guideline Development Group that the desirable consequences of the recommendations (for example, 
beneficial health outcomes) outweigh the undesirable consequences (for example, adverse effects) and takes 
into account other criteria, such as resources, acceptability, equity and feasibility. The recommendations are 
graded into two categories: 
1. A strong recommendation means the Guideline Development Group is confident that the desirable 
consequences of the recommendation outweigh the undesirable consequences.
2. A conditional recommendation means the Guideline Development Group concluded that the desirable 
consequences of the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable consequences but is not 
confident about these trade-offs (7).
According to the implications of differing strengths of GRADE recommendations for patients, clinicians and 
policy-makers, a strong recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations, while a conditional 
recommendation will require debate and the involvement of various stakeholders (7). 
Remarks were added to explain the recommendation and/or describe any relevant conditions. 
Implementation considerations were added to provide further information for the possible application of the 
recommendation.
WHO then drafted the full guidelines and circulated them electronically to the WHO Steering Committee, the 
Guideline Development Group and the External Review Group for comments and feedback. All input was 
considered and the guidelines were revised. External peer review was completed in November 2024, followed 
by editing prior to publication, but neither of these processes affected the formulated recommendations.
3. Recommendations for STI service 
delivery
11
These guidelines provide evidence-informed recommendations for the delivery of STI services (Table 1). They 
support the implementation of other WHO recommendations on STI prevention and care, including:
• managing people with symptoms of STIs 
• screening certain populations without symptoms
• treating people with confirmed STIs and their sexual partners. 
In addition, timely and effective treatment of STIs, ideally provided on the same day as the first contact 
with health care providers, is a crucial public health intervention that helps break the chain of infection 
transmission. 
A people-centred approach is essential – one that is 
respectful of and responsive to the preferences, needs 
and values of individuals and communities. This approach 
to STI services not only addresses the immediate health 
needs of individuals but also contributes to broader public 
health goals by reducing the spread of infections. People-
centred health services place individuals and communities, 
not diseases, at the centre of health systems.
These recommendations are based on the following overarching guiding principle:
3. Recommendations for STI service 
delivery
This section provides recommendations for delivering people-centred STI services, including the 
decentralization of services, the integration of STI care into other health services, task sharing the provision of 
certain STI services, and using digital health interventions to support the delivery of STI services.
3.1 Important considerations
3. Recommendations for STI service delivery
Timely and effective STI 
treatment is essential to 
interrupt transmission 
and protect public health
Health systems should be structured and strengthened to deliver quality-assured, 
accessible, equitable and people-centred services for the prevention, screening, diagnosis 
and management of sexually transmitted infections. 
Decision-makers should consider local and regional health system capacity, resources and 
population needs when selecting interventions to deliver these services. 
12
Recommendations on the delivery of health services for the prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections
In many settings, STI services are delivered through 
specialized clinics in urban centres or major hospitals, often 
coordinated by a central unit within the Ministry of Health. 
This centralized, vertical model of care has been favoured 
for its perceived efficiency and ability to link expenditures to 
measurable outcomes. 
Decentralizing STI services involves bringing care closer to the community by shifting care from centralized, 
often specialized services to more accessible locations, such as peripheral health facilities, community-based 
venues and locations outside conventional hospital settings.
This approach aims to reduce barriers to access, shorten waiting times, improve patient satisfaction and 
reduce the burden on centralized facilities. For example, syphilis testing may be available at decentralized 
locations, but reactive tests typically require referral to centralized facilities for confirmation and treatment. 
Expanding decentralized services to include these follow-up steps could, in principle, promote timely care and 
help reduce transmission..
Decentralization may require addressing policies that restrict decentralized service provision, as well as 
simplifying clinical protocols, task sharing with less specialized health workers, and engaging multidisciplinary 
teams to provide care in community-based or home-based settings. Decentralization can also involve 
collaborating with the private sector and the community to improve service delivery. Other recommendations 
related to decentralization have been developed by WHO, including services for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and 
tuberculosis (10-12).
Recommendation (new 2024)
WHO suggests the decentralization of services to improve access to prevention, screening, diagnosis and 
management of sexually transmitted infections. 
Conditional recommendation, low certainty in evidence of effects
Remarks: Decentralization means that quality-assured sexually transmitted infection services are 
provided beyond centralized health care facilities to meet the needs of people (for example, in 
primary care, peripheral or community-based health facilities, through outreach services or self-care 
interventions) and may involve referral to other sexually transmitted infection services. The addition of 
services should complement rather than replace centralized services.
3.1 Decentralization 
Implementation tips 
• Enable local health care facilities to:
» promote prevention and health care-seeking behaviour;
» assess and manage people with symptoms such as vaginal, urethral or anorectal 
discharge, lower abdominal pain or anogenital ulcers;
» screen certain populations who do not have symptoms, including men who have sex with 
men, sex workers, pregnant women and sexually active adolescents; and
» treat STIs confirmed by a molecular assay or rapid point-of-care test on the same day, and/
or based on syndromic management.
• Set up services to provide care that is confidential, private, non-judgemental and non-
stigmatizing.
• Provide people with a choice of locations to access services.
• Add other health care facilities to complement specialized services and ensure linkage by 
establishing formal referral systems. 
Decentralized STI services 
bring care closer to the 
community

3. Recommendations for STI service delivery
• Maintain specialized STI services for managing more complex cases and for training and 
research purposes. 
• Prioritize the addition of health care facilities and/or outreach services in areas with the 
highest STI prevalence, and to reach key and priority populations.
• Use existing facilities to reduce the cost and resource demands. 
• Train health workers who provide care in newly established services.
• Use service delivery opportunities in other facilities to increase awareness of STIs and sexual 
health.
Summary of the evidence
Several reviews of decentralization in STI care have been conducted; however, few identified studies that 
assessed the effects of these interventions on health outcomes, and one review included only studies from 
high-income countries (HICs) (13-17). One review included 64 studies that assessed screening in correctional 
facilities, community settings and patients’ homes in the United States of America. Gonorrhoea, chlamydia 
and syphilis were screened. The review reported “significant numbers of undiagnosed infections” were found 
in correctional facilities, but few infections were identified in sex venues and bathhouses. Some community-
based settings (college campuses, people on probation) reported a “significant burden of infections” , while 
others did not (such as homeless shelters, mobile vans and bars). Internet-based screening and home 
specimen collection found a high incidence of chlamydia but not of gonorrhoea (13). Another review also 
reported mixed results regarding the provision and uptake of STI testing (for example, test kits) among young 
people (16). Effects on other outcomes such as STI prevalence or incidence were not measured or reported.
Low- and moderate-certainty evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis of 142 studies from 34 
countries, including 20 studies (14%) from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), examined the effects of 
full and partial decentralization (as well as other interventions) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) care (18). This review 
found that in key populations, HCV testing and treatment uptake, as well as linkage to care, were greater with 
full and partial decentralization. However, in general populations, the effects were less clear. The review noted 
that treatment for HCV had changed over time to a more simplified regimen that did not require specialist-led 
care. A systematic review of 16 studies (15 in LMICs) on the decentralization of antiretroviral therapy found low- 
and moderate-certainty evidence for similar effects on viral suppression compared with no decentralization, 
and increased uptake of testing and treatment in peripheral health facilities (primary care/community sites). 
Greater retention in care was also reported (19). A review of eight studies on HIV and STI testing in pharmacies 
found small or no differences in uptake among underserved or hard-to-reach populations (15). 
Harms were not reported in the reviews, but the Guideline Development Group noted that with 
decentralization there is a risk of poor quality in peripheral services, which could lead to overprescribing 
and increased antimicrobial resistance. There was also concern that decentralization could lead to the loss 
of specialized services. To avoid this risk, it would be important to ensure that decentralized services are 
provided alongside specialized services. Overall, the Guideline Development Group agreed that the evidence 
from HCV and HIV care may be applicable to STI care. For example, the success of decentralizing HCV services, 
enabled by simplified testing and treatment algorithms, may parallel the use of the syndromic approach in 
STI management, which similarly does not require advanced laboratory diagnostics. This simplification could 
support the successful decentralization of STI services. The Guideline Development Group also agreed that 
local and outreach services have the potential to increase uptake of STI care (in particular for screening) and in 
settings with high prevalence, but the certainty of evidence is low.
Two systematic reviews addressed acceptability and values among people with STIs (16, 20). One review 
found that young people appreciated the convenience and accessibility of receiving care through pharmacies, 
though there were mixed feelings about privacy (16). The other review of implementation considerations 
for pharmacy-based STI services found that patients had positive experiences due to the accessibility and 
convenience of services, though privacy, stigma and fear of judgement remained barriers (20). Potential 
barriers at a systems level were identified in another review of decentralization in HIV care, which included 
training and education of staff and providers, supporting structures and referral systems (19). The Guideline 
Development Group agreed that people with STIs value confidentiality, privacy and the convenience of 
decentralized services, but barriers to implementation exist.
14
Recommendations on the delivery of health services for the prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections
Costs and resources were addressed in a systematic review of STI services outside clinics in the USA (13). 
It found that in correctional facilities, screening costs vary significantly by state, ranging from US$ 200 to 
US$ 3000 per case: in community-based settings, costs exceeded US$ 2400 per case. For internet-based 
home screening, high costs were associated with web development, marketing and logistics for at-home 
sample collection. The costs of training health workers or shifts in resources from different policy levels were 
not assessed. The Guideline Development Group agreed that costs could be reduced when prevalence in a 
setting is higher, and costs do not take into account the potential increase in awareness of and sensitization 
to STIs provided by peripheral facilities. Overall, the Guideline Development Group agreed that there is still 
uncertainty about whether decentralization may save costs. 
In summary, the Guideline Development Group agreed that there is low certainty in the evidence from 
studies involving people with HCV, HIV or STIs that decentralization improves the uptake of screening and 
treatment services. Decentralized services may be more accessible for hard-to-reach populations; however, 
there is potential for harms, such as a reduction in specialized clinics and an increased risk of antimicrobial 
resistance if high-quality care is not ensured. There may also be barriers to the feasibility and acceptability of 
decentralization. For example, individuals may not find community health centres private or confidential, and 
some may experience stigma related to STIs. These barriers are likely to be surmountable in many settings, 
and most individuals are likely to prefer services delivered in facilities located conveniently near their homes. 
Whether decentralization leads to cost savings remains uncertain.
Web Annex A presents the evidence-to-decision framework for decentralization. 
Research needs
A key research gap for decentralized STI care is the lack of data on health outcomes, as few studies assess 
whether decentralization reduces STI incidence or prevalence, despite its role in increasing access to 
screening. Additionally, because decentralization shows mixed effects across settings, research is needed to 
identify the settings and conditions where decentralization is most effective, the key components of successful 
strategies to decentralize services, and the populations for whom services may have different effects.
Most studies focus on HICs; there are limited data from LMICs, where more research is required to assess 
the feasibility and effectiveness of decentralized care. Concerns about inconsistent or low-quality care in 
decentralized health care services, such as limited counselling, lack of contact tracing and inappropriate 
management, also need to be addressed. Research should explore maintaining care quality in decentralized 
settings, including through adequate provider training.
Barriers such as privacy concerns and stigma in decentralized settings must be addressed to improve patient 
acceptability, particularly among marginalized populations. The cost-effectiveness of decentralization 
remains uncertain, with wide variations in costs reported across settings, necessitating further research on 
the long-term financial impacts. System-level barriers, such as staff training and referral systems, also need 
investigation to ensure decentralized care models are scalable and sustainable, especially in resource-limited 
settings. Issues of case reporting for national surveillance and partner services in decentralized care settings 
should also be addressed.

3. Recommendations for STI service delivery
3.3 Integration 
Integrated service delivery involves combining and co-
locating health services and resources across various 
health areas to provide comprehensive, people-centred 
care. Integration of STI services involves coordinating 
services across health areas, such as primary health 
care, maternal health care, SRH services (including 
contraception/family planning) and HIV services. 
Integrated health services aim to manage and deliver a continuum of care that spans health promotion, 
disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, disease management, rehabilitation and palliative care. By 
addressing multiple health needs in a single visit, integration could improve both the efficiency of health 
systems and the patient experience. 
Integration can be both horizontal, linking services at the same level of care, and vertical, connecting services 
across different levels, such as between hospitals and community-based care. The scope of integration is 
context-specific, depending on the health system and population needs, and should focus on populations 
and health service delivery platforms that offer opportunities for synergy and efficiency. Integration of 
services involves balancing efficiency with the effective use of health system resources, but it may also risk 
compromising progress made by disease-specific responses, particularly for key and affected populations. 
Careful planning is therefore essential to ensure that integration enhances, rather than undermines, existing 
health achievements and sustains gains in specific areas of care.
WHO has developed other recommendations and action statements related to integration of services. The 
Global Health Sector Strategy for 2022 to 2030 describes Action 92 to link STI services with other health services 
(4). In addition, a conditional recommendation was first published in 2016 stating that STI and family planning 
services can be integrated within HIV care settings (21).
Recommendation (new 2024)
WHO suggests the integration of services for prevention, screening, diagnosis and management of 
sexually transmitted infections into other health services, where relevant and feasible. 
Conditional recommendation, low certainty in evidence of effects
Remarks: Integration of sexually transmitted infection services should be prioritized in primary health 
care, HIV services, maternal health care, contraceptive/family planning services and other sexual and 
reproductive health services.
Implementation tips
• Integrate STI services within the same health care setting or during the same consultation.
• Integrate STI services into other relevant services (for example, HIV care, HIV PrEP , 
contraceptive/family planning services, antenatal care, and screening of pregnant women for 
chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis).
• Integrate STI services (such as asymptomatic screening) within HIV services and services for 
key and priority populations, including men who have sex with men, sex workers, pregnant 
women and sexually active adolescents. 
• Prioritize integration in venues, communities and populations where STI prevalence is highest. 
• Integrate testing and/or evaluation of people with symptoms of STIs (such as vaginal or 
urethral discharge, lower abdominal pain or anogenital ulcers) into primary health care 
services.
• Offer same-day treatment of STIs confirmed by a molecular assay, rapid point-of-care test or 
based on syndromic management.

16
Recommendations on the delivery of health services for the prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections
• Integrate services to provide quality-assured care that is confidential, private, non-judgemental 
and non-stigmatizing.
• Ensure that policies, resources and operational mechanisms (including data, supply chains and 
logistics support) are in place to support service integration.
• Train health workers who provide newly integrated services.
• Establish formal referral systems to ensure linkage with specialized STI services.
Summary of the evidence
Four systematic reviews were available that assessed the effects of integration of STI services in other services 
(22-25). One review found three studies integrating STI services into HIV care for women living with HIV and 
reported that two studies increased screening by 10–20% in the United Kingdom, but a study in Eswatini did 
not show more screening or greater provision of advice (23). A systematic review, updated in 2009, found 44 
studies, most from sub-Saharan Africa, assessing the integration of STI and HIV services into family planning 
services (22, 24). It found that integration may not improve continuity of care (for example, referrals or same-
day treatment), but may increase the uptake of family planning services (more recent studies found it may 
increase STI care), and client satisfaction was greater. There were mixed results for reaching “non-traditional 
clients” (such as males and young people), but client satisfaction was greater. Another review of interventions 
that integrated STI care into other clinics and primary care included 11 studies (25). Most studies found that STI 
screening increased by more than 20%. In addition, various reviews have found that the provision of screening 
tests for STIs in antenatal care may increase the provision of treatment and reduce adverse pregnancy and 
infant outcomes, although the reviews did not always verify that testing was provided in family planning 
services (26, 27). Other outcomes, such as STI prevalence or incidence and harms, were not measured or 
reported.
A systematic review of 142 studies from 34 countries (mostly HICs) assessed the effects of integrating HCV care 
into other existing care services at peripheral health facilities (18). It found greater HCV testing and treatment 
with integration in services such as primary care, harm reduction (needle and syringe programme/opioid 
agonist maintenance therapy sites), prisons and HIV services. These results were found in key populations, but 
results were unclear in the general population.
Overall, the Guideline Development Group agreed that integration of STI services in other health services may 
improve screening, particularly in contraception/family planning services and for key populations. However, 
the benefits of integrating screening and testing into other health services, or treatment into services, or the 
effects in the general population, are unclear. It is also likely that the effects will be dependent on training, 
supervision and resource capacity. 
One review included three studies that addressed costs (24). The studies found cost savings, likely due to 
the high number of clients and sufficient health worker resources, which would apply to settings with high 
prevalence or key populations. The Guideline Development Group also noted that integration may initially 
require additional funding and may not reduce resources but will increase accessibility of STI services. The 
same review found that there may be barriers to integration due to heavy workloads, lack of incentives, long 
wait times, inadequate training and supervision or limited access to laboratories.
In summary, low-certainty evidence from studies involving people with STIs, including HCV or HIV, suggests 
that integration may improve the uptake of screening and testing (in particular among key populations and 
within contraception/family planning services). However, there is greater uncertainty about its effects on 
treatment services, potential harms and outcomes in the general population. Effects on other outcomes, such 
as STI incidence or prevalence, as well as the quality and continuity of care, remain unknown. There may be 
some barriers to offering STI services within other health care services, and initial costs and resource needs 
may be higher.
Web Annex B presents the evidence-to-decision framework for integration. 
17
3. Recommendations for STI service delivery
Research needs
Research is needed to assess whether integration can reduce STI prevalence and improve health outcomes, 
particularly in non-key populations. While studies have shown increased client satisfaction and service uptake, 
the effects of integration on continuity of care, such as referrals and same-day treatment, and on disease 
prevalence remain unclear. Mixed results in reaching non-traditional clients, such as men and young people, 
suggest that more research is necessary to understand how to improve access for these groups through 
integration.
The effects of integration in broader health care services, such as primary care, and its potential to reach a 
wider audience need further evaluation. While there is some evidence of cost savings, particularly in high-
volume settings, the financial implications of integration in lower-prevalence settings are uncertain. Research 
should also examine the long-term costs and resource requirements, as integration may initially demand 
increased funding and staff capacity. 
As noted, there are also potential barriers to successful integration, such as heavy workloads, inadequate 
training and supervision, long wait times and limited laboratory access. Research is needed to explore 
strategies to address these barriers and ensure that integration can be sustainably scaled across different 
health care settings.
3.4 Task sharing 
Task sharing is an approach to expand service delivery, 
addressing the shortage of trained health workers by 
redistributing certain responsibilities from highly trained 
health practitioners to those with less training or fewer 
qualifications. 
This approach involves training less specialized health workers (including doctors, nurses, midwives, medical 
technologists, pharmacists and counsellors) and community health workers (including lay and peer health 
workers) to perform specific tasks conventionally provided by health care specialists. For STI service delivery, 
this could include the use of point-of-care tests or training to administer medications, such as benzathine 
penicillin injections for syphilis treatment.
WHO suggests the use of peer navigators to support people from key populations (10), whether provided 
through one-on-one interactions, informal groups or digital platforms. This can also include health promotion 
and education, counselling, condom provision, outreach services and supporting partner notification.
WHO has developed other, related recommendations for task sharing to improve access to family planning/
contraception, maternal and newborn health, and HIV and hepatitis C testing and treatment (11, 21, 28, 29).
Recommendation (new 2024)
WHO suggests that trained health practitioners can provide sexually transmitted infection services, and 
that community health workers can assist with service provision.
Conditional recommendation, low certainty in evidence of effects
Remarks: Quality assurance mechanisms, regular standardized training, supportive supervision and 
mentoring systems should be in place to ensure the provision of quality-assured services.
Task sharing expands access 
by enabling more health 
workers to provide essential 
STI services
18
Recommendations on the delivery of health services for the prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections
Implementation tips
• Task sharing can support STI service provision, including screening and testing, health 
promotion and education, condom provision, outreach services and partner notification.
• Provide training, mentorship and ongoing supervision to less specialized health workers, 
including community health workers, in clinical skills, particularly taking a sexual history and 
delivering care that is private, confidential, non-judgemental and non-stigmatizing.
• Develop standards of care that define roles based on skills and capacities; regulations and 
policies may need to be updated.
• Involve providers in determining appropriate roles.
• Provide adequate remuneration for health workers, including community health workers.
• Establish a quality assurance system, which may include monitoring services and collecting 
feedback from patients/clients. 
Summary of the evidence
Three systematic reviews, with minimal overlap of studies, provided information about the effects of 
pharmacy-based STI services (15, 20, 30). One review included one randomized controlled trial and 11 non-
comparative studies (including qualitative studies): 12 addressed chlamydia services, and two addressed 
gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis or syphilis. Eleven investigated screening (distribution of tests to home or blood 
tests/swabs/urine samples in pharmacies); and four also addressed treatment and partner treatment (20). 
Chlamydia positivity rates ranged from 0% to 12.8%; uptake of services varied from 18% to 28% when people 
were asked by the pharmacist, but was 87% when people were self-referred. Another review found nine 
studies related to chlamydia: four for screening, and five also addressing treatment. Three of these studies 
were not covered in the review by d’Entremont-Harris 2024 (20). These studies used treatment vouchers for 
free treatment at pharmacies, and about 40% to 87% of people redeemed the vouchers (30). A review of eight 
studies in underserved or hard-to-reach populations showed little difference in uptake of services provided by 
pharmacists (15).
A review of literature and interviews in the USA identified potential roles for lay health workers in community 
outreach and referral, community or school-based education, liaison between public health departments and 
the community, navigation and peer support for patients, outreach to people who drop out, and developing 
education materials (31). Additionally, an online survey of community health workers in Europe found that 
89% were involved in primary prevention, with about half involved in each of consultation and counselling, 
testing provision, linkage to care, and treatment and support (32). Cross-cutting activities included strategic 
and administrative tasks such as developing activities, monitoring and reporting, advocacy, advertising and 
needs assessment. The reviews did not report on harms.
For other conditions, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 142 studies from 34 countries (20 studies were 
from LMICs) examined the effects of task sharing with non-specialists, alongside other simplified service 
delivery interventions such as decentralization and integration, on outcomes across the HCV cascade of care 
(18). There were 46 studies of care delivered by non-specialists, 24 studies of care delivered by non-specialists 
supported through telehealth, and 51 studies of care delivered by health care specialists. The review found 
moderate-certainty evidence that cure rates were similar (a difference of 0% to 6%) among patients treated 
by health care specialists or other health workers (including primary health care workers, other health care 
specialists and nurses), even when more complex treatment regimens were used. Multiple systematic reviews 
in HIV care found good health outcomes when care was provided by nurses or lay and community health 
workers with appropriate training and supervision (33, 34). Lay health workers could provide HIV counselling 
and testing with rapid tests, and nurses could provide testing during pregnancy and initiate antiretroviral 
therapy. Another review in HIV care found 17 studies and reported that roles for community health workers 
included: 1) education and health promotion; 2) HIV care (such as testing, screening, medication delivery and 
follow-up); and 3) support (such as treatment, referral, home care and psychosocial support) (35).
19
3. Recommendations for STI service delivery
There is evidence for costs and resources from the review for HCV care from four cost-effectiveness studies. 
The studies reported that task sharing with nurses or less specialized health workers reduced costs and had 
similar or better outcomes, concluding that task sharing is highly cost-effective. The Guideline Development 
Group noted that although the cost of other health workers may be lower, the health workforce required may 
be greater. Services provided by pharmacists were trusted and highly accepted by clients, but privacy concerns 
were unclear (16, 20, 30). It was also found that pharmacists were comfortable and satisfied with providing STI 
services but had questions about remuneration, policy regulations and recruitment (20, 30). In reviews of HIV 
and HCV care, training and expertise, resources and funding were concerns (11, 35).
Overall, there was low certainty in the evidence for HCV, HIV and STI services, which indicated that task sharing 
may result in similar health outcomes and service uptake, particularly when pharmacists or community/
lay health workers provide care. These reviews did not report harms, but there may be some barriers to the 
feasibility and acceptability of task sharing. Individuals may not find pharmacy services private or confidential 
and may feel stigma related to STIs, making training for pharmacists essential. These barriers would likely be 
surmountable in many settings. The effect on costs and resources remains unclear. A list of potential roles that 
could be shared, found in the literature for provision of STI services, includes education and health promotion; 
testing, screening, medication delivery and follow-up; and support (peer, treatment, referral, home care and 
psychosocial support).
Web Annex C presents the evidence-to-decision framework for task sharing.
Research needs
There are limited data on health outcomes when less specialized health workers, including community health 
workers, take on STI-related tasks such as screening, testing and treatment. While there is evidence from other 
conditions, such as HIV and HCV, showing that less specialized health workers can achieve similar outcomes 
to health care specialists, more research is needed to confirm that similar results can be achieved for STIs 
in general. Although task sharing has been shown to increase service uptake, there is uncertainty about its 
effectiveness in underserved populations and broader STI prevention efforts.
Another area requiring further research is the privacy concerns associated with task sharing, including 
questions about these services ensuring confidentiality and whether stigma related to STIs affects service 
uptake. Similarly, while less specialized health workers are comfortable providing STI services, issues around 
remuneration, regulatory frameworks and recruitment need further investigation. 
Training and supervision are critical factors in task sharing, especially for less specialized health workers 
providing STI care. Evidence from HIV and HCV care emphasizes the importance of adequate training and 
support to maintain service quality, yet this has not been extensively studied for STI services. Additionally, while 
some studies suggest that task sharing can reduce costs, especially when care is shifted to less specialized health 
workers, the overall impact on health care resources and long-term cost-effectiveness remains unclear. Further 
research is also needed to explore implementing and sustaining various roles in STI care.

3.5 Digital health interventions
Digital platforms have been developed to support a 
variety of health care activities and communication. 
Examples include contact tracing and other network-
based testing approaches, as well as education and 
ongoing support to improve STI detection, treatment 
and prevention.  
Digital tools can also link people with STIs and their partners to testing and treatment services by offering 
features that support communication, such as online consultations (telemedicine), automated test scheduling 
and secure result portals. These services often include symptom checkers, access to home testing kits and 
digital reminders to support treatment adherence, enhancing accessibility and privacy. 
Other WHO guidelines have addressed the use of digital health interventions with different target audiences 
(36). In addition, online delivery of HIV, viral hepatitis and STI services may be another option for key 
populations (10).
Implementation tips 
• Digital health interventions should complement, not replace, in-person STI services.
• Ensure data security and confidentiality when implementing digital health interventions.
• Provide opt-out options and follow applicable legislation and policies. 
• Use content formats that are appropriate for users to improve communication (for example, 
mobile apps, web platforms, SMS, audio messages or files).
• Consider equity and sociocultural factors, ensuring that digital interventions do not exclude 
people without access to technology.
• Ensure that infrastructure is in place to support the effective use of technology, including 
reliable internet connectivity and access to mobile devices.
Summary of the evidence
Two reviews were conducted on the use of digital interventions in SRH (37, 38). Digital interventions included 
videos, audio files, text messages, voice mail, email or online websites and modules. One review found that 
targeted digital health communication may reduce STI rates in adolescents compared with non-targeted 
communication (38). Another review, which included 28 studies, found little to no effect on the incidence of 
STIs or on sexual risk behaviour (37). 
Low and very low certainty evidence of the use of digital health interventions in multiple conditions found 
mixed results for outcomes such as awareness and knowledge, adherence to treatment, communication 
of test results, follow-up and retention (36). The digital health interventions included text messaging, voice 
response, games and other applications, social media and websites. Few harms were reported, but one review 
found very low certainty evidence of an increase in physical violence against women related to the use of 
digital health interventions (which occurred in one woman in one of the studies). Another review of 45 studies 
Recommendation (new 2024)
WHO suggests using digital health interventions to complement in-person health care services for 
sexually transmitted infections.

interventions.

3. Recommendations for STI service delivery
found that the results services were used by nearly 70% of people who used testing services. Most viewed their 
results on the same day they were posted; patient satisfaction was high; time to see results was shortened; 
there was a preference for phone calls when internet access was limited, comprehension was high; and there 
was little or no anxiety (39).
One review found that costs increased slightly with digital interventions versus no intervention, but these 
interventions may be less expensive than phone calls or letters (38). Across three reviews, digital health 
interventions were generally found to be acceptable, supportive, convenient, empowering and reassuring, but 
there may be concerns about privacy and confidentiality (36-38). There may also be concerns about the need 
for reliable internet, access to electricity, ownership of mobile devices, informed consent and stable phone 
numbers (36, 38). 
Overall, there is low certainty in the evidence for small benefits of digital health interventions; harms were 
not measured or reported. Individuals generally found digital health interventions acceptable, although some 
may have concerns about privacy and confidentiality, and some may not have access, or reliable access, to the 
technology. Digital health interventions are likely feasible to provide, although there will be costs associated 
with creating and maintaining these services.
Research needs
Further research should focus on identifying the most effective digital strategies for promoting sexual health 
and preventing and managing STIs in diverse populations and on establishing best practices for integrating 
digital health tools into STI services. Evidence is also needed on how digital health interventions impact 
broader sexual health outcomes, such as STI incidence and sexual risk behaviour, and their effects on STI care, 
including patient satisfaction, patient retention and continuity of care.
Safeguarding privacy and ensuring informed consent on digital health platforms is another key area for 
further research. While digital health interventions are generally accepted by users, concerns about privacy, 
technology access and cost need to be addressed to ensure their broader use and effectiveness. 
The cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions also requires more investigation. Although digital 
interventions may lower costs, the initial investment in creating and maintaining these services can be high. 
Research should assess the long-term financial sustainability of digital health tools for STI care.

Box 4.1. Existing WHO recommendations on self-care interventions for STIs
Self-collection of samples for STI testing (41)
• Self-collection of samples for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis should be made 
available as an additional approach to deliver STI testing services (strong recommendation, 
moderate-certainty evidence).
• Self-collection of samples for Treponema pallidum (syphilis) and Trichomonas vaginalis may be 
considered as an additional approach to deliver STI testing services (conditional recommendation, 
low-certainty evidence).
HPV self-sampling (41)
• HPV self-sampling should be made available as an additional approach to sampling in cervical 
cancer screening services for individuals aged 30–60 years (strong recommendation, moderate-
certainty evidence).
Syphilis self-testing (42)
• Syphilis self-testing may be offered as an additional approach to syphilis testing services 
(conditional recommendation, low certainty in evidence of effects). 
4.1 Self-care interventions
Self-care interventions have the potential to 
increase choice when they are accessible and 
affordable, and to provide more opportunities for 
individuals to make informed decisions about their 
health and health care. Self-care builds on existing 
approaches, such as task sharing, by entrusting 
individuals with certain aspects of their own care.
WHO’s current working definition of self-care is the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote 
health, prevent disease, maintain health and cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a 
health worker (40). The scope of self-care in this definition includes health promotion, disease prevention and 
control, self-testing and self-medication, providing care to dependent persons, seeking hospital or specialist 
care if necessary and rehabilitation, including palliative care. 
For STIs, greater efforts are needed globally to expand STI testing services, and self-care interventions are one 
way to facilitate this, including self-collection, self-sampling or self-testing for diagnosis. These approaches 
might also address some barriers that often prevent people from seeking STI testing from a health worker or 
health care facility, such as concerns about autonomy, inconvenience, stigma and lack of privacy.
WHO recommends a number of self-care interventions for STIs, as summarized in Box 4.1.
Self-care options help 
overcome barriers to 
accessing STI services from a 
health worker or facility
24
Recommendations on the delivery of health services for the prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections
Self-collection or self-sampling allows individuals to collect their own specimens, such as urine, blood or 
swabs from anatomical sites, either at a health care facility or elsewhere. These specimens can then be sent 
to a laboratory for testing. Research shows that self-collected samples are as accurate as those collected by 
health workers, and self-collection is both feasible and acceptable for various populations.
Self-testing takes self-care a step further, allowing individuals to perform a simple rapid test on their own and 
interpret the results at their convenience. Similar to HIV self-testing, syphilis self-testing is gaining momentum 
as a private and convenient option for individuals who might not otherwise seek testing. If a test result is 
reactive, individuals are then encouraged to seek confirmatory testing and treatment within the formal health 
care system. They could also be encouraged to distribute a self-test kit to partners. It is important to ensure 
the use of quality-assured, WHO prequalified tests or those approved by internationally recognized regulatory 
authorities. Self-testing for other STIs is likely to become available in the future.
WHO has developed guidance that offers further implementation considerations for delivering self-care 
interventions for health, including: 
• WHO guideline on self-care interventions for health and well-being (40).

5. Implementation considerations for 
STI service delivery
Health systems should adopt appropriate people-centred service delivery approaches that further enhance 
equity through the principles of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality. As noted above, 
recommended approaches include decentralizing services, integrating STI care with other health services, 
sharing tasks among health workers, utilizing digital health interventions and promoting self-care. Each of 
these approaches plays a role in ensuring that STI services are responsive to the needs of the population while 
maintaining privacy and confidentiality, reducing the burden on the health care system and improving public 
health outcomes. However, health systems may need to develop new policies or legislation to implement 
these recommended approaches. Additional implementation considerations are outlined in other WHO 
guidelines related to STI prevention and care.
5.1 Key principles of STI service delivery
Effective service delivery is central to organizing health systems to achieve the desired public health outcomes. 
For STI services, this means defining the essential service packages, selecting appropriate models for 
delivering care and ensuring that the health system functions efficiently to meet the needs of the population. A 
people-centred approach to STI service delivery respects and responds to the preferences, needs and values of 
individuals and communities, making services more accessible and acceptable.
Grounded in the human right to health, STI services for all populations should adhere to the following 
principles to ensure equity: 
• Availability: STI services should be available within sufficiently functioning health care facilities, 
resources and coordinated services to provide a comprehensive package of interventions, including 
testing, treatment, counselling and prevention services. 
• Accessibility: These services must be accessible to all individuals, regardless of their background or 
circumstances. Accessibility entails that services are physically reachable, affordable and provided 
without discrimination. Efforts should be made to ensure privacy and confidentiality and to remove 
barriers such as stigma, geographical distance or financial constraints that may prevent people from 
seeking care. 
• Acceptability: STI services must be acceptable to those they serve. This means that they should 
respect medical ethics and be culturally sensitive, appropriate for different developmental stages, 
gender-sensitive, non-judgemental and non-stigmatizing. Services should be people-centred, involving 
shared decision-making, catering to the specific needs of various population groups and upholding 
international standards of confidentiality and informed consent. 
• Quality: High-quality STI services are essential for effective care. They should be evidence-based, safe 
and effective, focusing on adequately trained individuals to provide timely and equitable care. Services 
should be integrated and efficient, ensuring that all aspects of care work together seamlessly to achieve 
the best health outcomes. 
27
5. Implementation considerations for STI service delivery
5.2 Key considerations for developing models of service delivery
When designing effective models of service delivery for STI services, it is essential to apply a comprehensive 
and flexible framework that addresses the "who, " "what, " "where, " "when" and "how" of service delivery.  
This ensures that services are high-quality, people-centred and responsive to the local context and population 
needs. A critical aspect of this process is identifying priority populations for service delivery, including 
pregnant women, adolescents and young people, and key populations (see section 5.5 on STI service delivery 
for key and priority populations). 
Models should align with the principles of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality while considering 
local epidemiology, resource availability and the acceptability of services to both users and health workers. 
Health systems should also evaluate local infrastructure and resources to determine the most feasible 
approaches, including both digital health and self-care interventions. Cost-effectiveness is a key factor: health 
systems should use existing facilities and resources where possible while gradually expanding services based 
on need and capacity.
• Who should deliver STI services? Effective STI service delivery requires a diverse range of health 
workers beyond health care specialists. In addition to doctors, services may be delivered by trained 
nurses, midwives, community and lay health workers. Delegating specific tasks, such as prevention 
services, testing or counselling, to less specialized health workers may increase service efficiency 
and reach while maintaining quality. Engaging community or lay health workers, particularly from 
marginalized populations, may build trust and encourage service uptake. Self-care interventions, where 
individuals manage certain aspects of their care, may further extend the reach of services and empower 
individuals to manage their own health. (See section 3.4 for more on task sharing.)
• What STI services should be delivered? The package of STI services should be tailored to local 
needs and resources. A comprehensive package typically includes prevention (education, condoms, 
vaccines and other evidence-based interventions), diagnosis (diagnostic tests or syndromic approach), 
treatment (timely administration of effective antibiotics or antivirals), partner services (notification and 
treatment) and referral systems to link with specialized services. The goal is to prevent, treat and cure 
infections when possible, minimize complications and reduce future infections. (See section 5.3 for 
more on packages of STI services.)
• Where should STI services be delivered? STI services should be provided in a variety of settings 
to ensure broad accessibility. Service delivery locations should reflect local infrastructure and 
epidemiological needs. Options include decentralizing services to primary health care facilities (often 
the first point of contact for patients), community-based settings (including mobile clinics, outreach 
programmes or community-led initiatives), digital platforms (such as online consultations and 
telehealth), self-care approaches (home-based self-collection or self-testing kits) and integration with 
other health programmes (for example, integrating STI services into existing antenatal health, SRH, 
adolescent health or HIV services) (see section 3.2 on decentralization, and section 3.3 on integration). 
Service delivery models need to be tailored to the needs of special settings, including prisons and other 
closed settings, as well as settings of humanitarian concern (see section 5.6 on special settings).
• When should STI services be provided? STI services should be available when and where they are 
most needed, ensuring timely access for all populations. Services can be delivered continuously 
through integrated health systems that offer STI services as part of routine care, on-demand via 
community outreach or mobile units that serve key and priority populations or underserved regions, 
or proactively through periodic screening campaigns targeting high-prevalence areas or priority 
populations. Flexibility in service hours, including evening or weekend availability, may also improve 
access, particularly for working people or those with limited access to transportation.
• How should STI services be delivered? STI service delivery should be flexible and responsive to 
the needs of the population and prioritize populations disproportionately affected by STIs (see 
section 5.5 on STI service delivery for key and priority populations). All STI testing services should 
adhere to WHO’s five Cs (consent, confidentiality, counselling, correct test results and connection or 
linkage to prevention, care and treatment) (21). Decentralizing care to primary health care facilities 
and integrating STI services into other health programmes may make services more accessible to 
underserved populations. Digital health and self-care approaches can also be employed and may 
reduce stigma, increase privacy and extend care to hard-to-reach populations (see section 3.5 on digital 
health and 4.1 on self-care).

Recommendations on the delivery of health services for the prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections
5.3 Developing a comprehensive package of STI services
A comprehensive package of STI services aims to prevent infection, provide accurate diagnosis and effective 
treatment, achieve cures, reduce infectivity, minimize complications, prevent future infections and ensure that 
sexual partners are appropriately treated. To achieve these goals, the following should be done for anyone 
attending an STI service (whether they show symptoms or not): 
• A complete medical and sexual history is taken and documented.
• Symptomatic individuals receive an accurate diagnosis (either syndromic or based on diagnostic tests).
• Asymptomatic individuals are offered screening with diagnostic tests (based on population-specific 
guidance).
• Effective treatment is provided to manage the infection.
• Health education and counselling are offered to help the individual understand the infection and 
reduce future risk and transmission risk to partners.
• Guidance on adhering to treatment is provided to ensure the best outcomes.
• Condoms (male/external or female/internal) and condom-compatible lubricants are promoted and/or 
provided.
• HIV PrEP and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) are promoted and/or provided when applicable.
• Additional preventive interventions are offered, such as hepatitis A/B and HPV vaccines, voluntary 
medical male circumcision (where appropriate) or suppressive therapy for genital herpes.
• Individuals are encouraged or supported to notify sexual partners to prevent further infection (as part of 
broader network-based testing strategies). 
• Clinical follow-up is arranged when needed to monitor treatment success. 
• Referral to specialized services is provided when necessary.
A comprehensive package of STI services should include prevention and promotion of appropriate health-
seeking behaviour and address both symptomatic and prioritized asymptomatic individuals. Everyone should 
receive the care they need in a non-judgemental and non-stigmatizing environment, regardless of their 
condition or their likelihood of seeking treatment. 
A comprehensive package should be flexible, offering different entry points based on local needs and 
resources. It often requires integration with other health services. Tailoring services to meet the needs of 
specific populations, such as adolescents and people from key populations, is crucial for ensuring that they 
receive the additional services and support they require. A needs-based approach to developing the package 
is suggested rather than trying to provide overly comprehensive services from the start.
29
5.4 Addressing gaps in the care cascade
At any given time, only a fraction of individuals with STIs seek treatment, and even fewer are successfully 
cured. Understanding the cascade from infection to cure helps to identify gaps in care and improve outcomes. 
This care cascade tracks the steps from STI infection, through seeking care, receiving appropriate treatment 
and ultimately achieving a cure. Attrition occurs at each stage, and these losses must be addressed to improve 
overall treatment rates.
Fig. 5.1 illustrates this care cascade, highlighting the common points where individuals are lost to care and 
outlining key interventions that can reduce these losses. On the left side, common barriers to achieving a cure 
are shown, while the right side highlights examples of interventions to reduce attrition at each stage of care.

Recommendations on the delivery of health services for the prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections
Factors influencing the rate of attrition from the care cascade include poor quality of care, limited access to 
health care services, insufficient health worker training, unavailability of essential medicines and stigma and 
negative attitudes toward individuals with STIs. Programme managers should identify where these losses are 
occurring along the care pathway and focus on areas that need improvement. The goal is to increase retention 
in the care cascade through to cure for all individuals with STIs, advancing progress toward universal health 
coverage.
5.5 STI service delivery for key and priority populations
STI service delivery should prioritize the unique needs of populations disproportionately affected by STIs, 
many of whom also face heightened risk for HIV and viral hepatitis. These priority populations often experience 
vulnerabilities related to social and structural determinants of health, such as discrimination, marginalization 
and exclusion. Addressing their needs requires a comprehensive approach that integrates human rights 
protections, reduces stigma and ensures equitable access to services. Priority populations may include (4):
• key populations, including men who have sex with men, sex workers and their clients, trans and gender-
diverse people, people who inject and use drugs, and people in prisons and other closed settings;
• adolescents and young people, including young key populations;
• people exposed through unsafe blood supplies and medical procedures;
• children exposed through vertical transmission or early childhood infection;
• pregnant and breastfeeding women;
• women and girls, including adolescent girls and young women, who face gender inequalities, violence 
and heightened biological risks related to sex;
• migrants, mobile populations and those affected by conflict and civil unrest;
• indigenous people; and
• people with disabilities.
STI services should be designed to meet the diverse needs of these populations, ensuring that they are 
accessible, confidential and non-discriminatory. Priority populations should be defined based on local 
epidemiology and health system contexts, using an intersectional lens that considers overlapping social and 
structural vulnerabilities and health risks.
In the adaptation and implementation of guidelines for STI service delivery, it is essential to ensure the 
protection and promotion of the human rights of people seeking care. This includes actively preventing stigma 
and discrimination in health care settings, promoting gender equity and ensuring that the use of services is 
voluntary. In particular, adolescents, young people and people living with HIV often face barriers to obtaining 
care. Increasing access to STI services for these groups is critical to reducing the burden of STIs globally. 
31
Key populations
Key populations, including men who have sex with men, sex workers, trans and gender diverse people, 
and people who inject drugs, are disproportionately affected by STIs and may face significant barriers to 
accessing care due to stigma, criminalization and fear of legal or social consequences. In many settings people 
from key populations may not disclose their identities or behaviours, especially where sex work, same-sex 
relationships, non-conforming gender expression or drug use are criminalized. Therefore, services must 
be designed to be accessible, confidential and non-discriminatory, ensuring that individuals feel safe and 
protected when seeking care.
The WHO Consolidated guidelines on HIV, viral hepatitis and STI prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for 
key populations offer comprehensive guidance on increasing access to and delivering STI services for these 
groups (10). Additional WHO guidance provides practical strategies for implementing comprehensive HIV and 
STI programmes for specific key populations:
• Implementing comprehensive HIV and STI programmes with sex workers: practical approaches from 
collaborative interventions (43); 
• Implementing comprehensive HIV and STI programmes with men who have sex with men: practical 
guidance for collaborative interventions (44); 
• Implementing comprehensive HIV and STI programmes with transgender people: practical guidance for 
collaborative interventions (45); and
• Implementing comprehensive HIV and HCV programmes with people who inject drugs: practical guidance 
for collaborative interventions (46).
Adolescents and young people
Adolescents and young people are also a priority population for STI service delivery. They often face distinct 
barriers, such as limited knowledge about sexual health, fear of judgement and concerns about confidentiality. 
It is essential to provide adolescent-friendly health services that are accessible, confidential and tailored to 
their specific needs. Health workers should be trained to offer non-judgemental, youth-centred care, creating 
a supportive environment where young people feel comfortable seeking services.
WHO provides key guidance to improve adolescent health care, including:
• Global standards for quality health-care services for adolescents: a guide to implement a standards-
driven approach to improve the quality of health care services for adolescents (47). 
• Adolescent friendly health services for adolescents living with HIV: from theory to practice (48).
Pregnant and breastfeeding women 
Pregnant and breastfeeding women are priority populations for STI service delivery, as untreated STIs during 
pregnancy and, in some cases, during breastfeeding can lead to serious health outcomes for both the mother 
and newborn. WHO’s recommendations on antenatal care emphasize the importance of syphilis screening 
and treatment, integrated as part of the triple elimination efforts alongside HIV and hepatitis B screening, to 
prevent adverse outcomes, including stillbirth, neonatal death and congenital infection. 
In settings with a high prevalence of infections, screening for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis should also be 
integrated into maternal health care to prevent additional adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, low birth 
weight and neonatal infections. High-prevalence settings may be defined by local epidemiological data and 
population-specific risk.
WHO provides key guidance to improve maternal and child health care, including:
• WHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience (49).
5. Implementation considerations for STI service delivery
32
Recommendations on the delivery of health services for the prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections
5.6 STI service delivery in special settings
Service delivery models for STIs must be adapted to the unique needs of special settings, including prisons 
and other closed settings and areas of humanitarian concern. In these environments, providing equitable, 
continuous and accessible health care is critical to prevent and manage STIs effectively.
Health services in prisons and other closed settings should be equivalent to those available to the broader 
community. It is essential to ensure that individuals in these settings have access to STI services of equal 
quality, and continuity of care should be maintained when people move within these settings or return to the 
broader community. 
Mobile and displaced populations, such as refugees or migrants, often face significant barriers to accessing 
local health care services. Displacement often separates individuals from their usual support networks 
and health care providers. These populations may lack adequate access to STI services due to a lack of 
infrastructure, unfamiliarity with local health care systems, or legal and cultural barriers. In humanitarian 
settings these vulnerabilities can be exacerbated by disrupted health service delivery, further limiting access to 
essential services. 
During conflicts, crises and emergencies, health systems often become overstretched, creating unprecedented 
demands on both health care providers and affected communities. The disruptions of local or national 
health systems or supply chains, combined with the stigma surrounding STIs and other SRH services, present 
significant challenges to delivering care in these settings. 
To address these challenges, strategic adaptations in service delivery are necessary. These adaptations 
must align with ethical principles, such as equity in the allocation of and access to resources, respect for 
self-determination and the protection of dignity and human rights (50). These principles ensure that even 
in the most fragile environments, individuals can access lifesaving STI services without discrimination or 
compromise to their rights.
The Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for SRH in crisis situations outlines essential, lifesaving activities 
to address the SRH needs of populations at the onset of a humanitarian crisis (51). STI services are a critical 
component of the MISP , with the objective of preventing the transmission of HIV and other STIs, and reducing

Recommendations on the delivery of health services for the prevention and care of sexually transmitted infections
6. Disseminating and updating the 
guidelines
6.1 Dissemination
 
These guidelines will be made available on the WHO website at https://www.who.int/health-topics/sexually-
transmitted-infections – click on “Guidelines” . There are also links to other supporting documents.
WHO headquarters will work with WHO regional offices and country offices to ensure that countries receive 
support in adapting, implementing and monitoring the utility of these guidelines.
Every level of WHO (headquarters, regional offices and country offices) will work with regional and national 
partners – including the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), non-governmental organizations 
and other agencies implementing HIV, STI and SRH services to ensure an integrated approach to preventing 
and controlling STIs. WHO will advocate that these external partners support the dissemination and 
implementation of these guidelines.
These guidelines will be disseminated at conferences related to HIV, STIs and SRH and through electronic 
media, and they will be included in WHO’s forthcoming consolidated guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, 
treatment and care of STIs.
6.2 Updating the STI guidelines and user feedback
 
A system of monitoring relevant new evidence and updating the recommendations in these guidelines will be 
established. These STI recommendations are based on systematic reviews of the literature, including reviews 
found in other WHO guidelines, such as reviews conducted on HIV and hepatitis C. When updating these STI 
recommendations, we will search other source guidelines to determine if that literature has been updated. 
Mechanisms for disseminating new information will be put into operation. Some of these mechanisms will 
involve electronic communication. 
An electronic follow-up survey of key end-users of these guidelines will be conducted one year after they have 
been disseminated. The results of the survey will be used to identify challenges and barriers to the uptake of 
the guidelines, evaluate their usefulness for improving service delivery for STIs and identify topics or gaps that 
need to be addressed in future editions.

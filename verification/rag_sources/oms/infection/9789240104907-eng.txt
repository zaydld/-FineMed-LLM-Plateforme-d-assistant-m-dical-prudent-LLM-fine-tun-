The global burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is high, with more than 30 pathogens, including 
bacteria, viruses and parasites, known to be transmitted through sexual contact. WHO estimates for 
2020 indicate that there were 374 million new cases of curable STIs (gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis and 
trichomoniasis) among people 15–49 years old. This includes 156 million new cases of trichomoniasis, 128.5 
million new cases of chlamydia, 82.4 million new cases of gonorrhoea and 7.1 million new cases of syphilis, 
amounting to about 1 million new curable STIs every day. In 2022, the number of new syphilis cases increased 
to 8.0 million.1
Chlamydia, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, and gonorrhoea, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, are the 
most common bacterial STIs worldwide and result in substantial morbidity and economic costs. Syphilis is a 
bacterial STI caused by Treponema pallidum that results in substantial morbidity and mortality. In addition, 
congenital syphilis can be devastating to a fetus if infection during pregnancy is not detected and treated 
sufficiently early in pregnancy.
WHO has set ambitious targets in the recent global health sector strategies for HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs. To 
achieve these targets, such as a 90% reduction in both gonorrhoea and syphilis infections by 2030, the strategy 
emphasizes the importance of improving access to prevention, diagnostic and treatment services for people 
with STIs. These guidelines support the management of asymptomatic STIs.
One challenge to responding to the burden of STIs is that these infections can be asymptomatic to a large and 
variable extent. In some individuals, such as biological women, gonococcal and chlamydial infections of the 
cervix can be asymptomatic in about 50–97% of cases. In anatomical sites other than the urethra and cervix, 
such as the anorectal and oropharyngeal sites, symptoms are usually minimal to absent in up to about 85% of 
cases.
Further, the treatment of people with STIs is complicated by the rapidly changing antimicrobial susceptibility 
patterns of various sexually transmitted pathogens, such as N. gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium, to 
available antibiotics, with concerns about the eventual development of untreatable infections with serious 
sexual and reproductive health consequences. Asymptomatic STIs, especially in the pharynx or rectum, may 
be a reservoir for the selection of antimicrobial resistance when antimicrobial agents are given for other 
conditions but are below the minimal inhibitory concentration of the pre-existing STI pathogens.
Antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae has emerged for every drug available for empirical first-line 
treatment, with the extended-spectrum cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, currently being the last option in most 
countries. Certain antibiotics, including azithromycin, are at relatively high risk of selection of bacterial 
resistance, and use needs to be reserved for certain pathogens, including M. genitalium.
These guidelines focus on the management of people with asymptomatic STIs by providing evidence-informed 
recommendations to screen for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. These recommendations complement the 
WHO guidelines on syphilis screening among pregnant women, sex workers and men who have sex with men, 
syphilis self-testing and treponemal and non-treponemal testing; guidelines on STI partner services; guidelines 
on treatment of people with specific STIs (N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, M. genitalium, T. pallidum, 
Trichomonas vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, Candida albicans, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus 
[genital warts]) and guidelines for the management of symptomatic STIs. All these guidelines will be included 
in the forthcoming WHO consolidated guidelines on STI prevention and care.
The objectives of these guidelines are:
• to provide evidence-informed recommendations on the screening of people with asymptomatic STIs; 
and
• to support countries and national programmes in developing national guidelines for the management 
of STIs towards reaching the 2030 global sector strategy targets on STIs.
These guidelines are intended for policy-makers, programme managers, health-care workers and any other 
public health professionals responsible for planning or implementing STI services (stand-alone or integrated 
with other health services). These guidelines will also be a resource for donor and development agencies,

Executive summary
viii
Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections
international, nongovernmental, civil society and community-based organizations as well as those working 
with or led by key populations and the communities affected the most by STIs, including HIV.
These guidelines were developed following the methods outlined in the 2014 WHO handbook for guideline 
development. Systematic reviews and modelling were conducted to address the guideline objectives. 
The Guideline Development Group reviewed the evidence and made recommendations. The Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the 
evidence and formulate the recommendations. The External Review Group reviewed the guidelines before 
they were submitted to the WHO Guidelines Review Committee.
 
Summary of recommendations
These guidelines provide recommendations for the asymptomatic screening of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 
Chlamydia trachomatis. The recommendations apply to pregnant women, sexually active adolescents and 
young people, sex workers and men who have sex with men (Table 1). 
The recommendations are based on the combined prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis at a 
population level. For sexually active adolescents and young people, a high prevalence in a setting is suggested 
to be about 15–20% combined for both infections. For pregnant women, due to the adverse health effects 
on infants, a combined prevalence of 10% in a setting may be considered high. Decision-makers may have 
access to prevalence data from countries, programmes or clinics, which can be used to determine whether 
screening should be implemented for the population addressed in the recommendation. Note that the 
recommendations are intended to be applied based on population-level prevalence and do not involve an 
assessment of an individual’s risk of infection.
The frequency of screening should depend on sexual exposure, rates of partner exchange and transmission 
and the cost of the test. It should be balanced against the cost, the number of cases detected and the 
consequences of not screening. For sex workers and men who have sex with men, screening is advised at least 
annually or every six months. 
Recommendations Strength of recommendation and 
certainty of evidence
Pregnant women
WHO suggests that pregnant women who have no symptoms of a 
sexually transmitted infection and are accessing health-care services for 
antenatal visits be screened for N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis 
in settings where prevalence is high and resources and capacity are 
available. Recommendations for the management of symptomatic 
sexually transmitted infections should continue to be followed.a
Remarks:
• This recommendation applies to population-level prevalence 
rather than individual risk assessments, which have been shown 
to lack accuracy. This recommendation also applies to screening 
with either a quality-assured molecular assay, such as nucleic-acid 
amplification testing or a rapid test with a minimum sensitivity of 
80% and specificity of 90%, where treatment is available.
• Screening should be voluntary with informed consent. Treat for 
N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis based on the results of 
the quality-assured test using the national treatment guidelines. 
Sexual partners of people testing positive should also be tested and 
treated, if positive.

Adolescents and young people
WHO suggests that sexually active adolescents and young people (10–24 
years old) who have no symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection 
and are accessing health-care services be screened for N. gonorrhoeae 
and/or C. trachomatis in settings where prevalence is high and resources 
and capacity are available. Recommendations for the management 
of symptomatic sexually transmitted infections should continue to be 
followed.a
Remarks:
• When balancing resources and benefits of screening, adolescent 
girls and young women may be prioritized. This recommendation 
applies to population-level prevalence rather than individual risk 
assessments, which have been shown to lack accuracy. However, 
exploring sexual activity in the past 12 months prior to screening 
is essential. This recommendation also applies to screening with 
either a quality-assured molecular assay, such as nucleic-acid 
amplification testing, or a rapid test with a minimum sensitivity of 
80% and specificity of 90%, where treatment is available.
• Screening should be voluntary with informed consent. Treat for 
N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis based on the results of the 
quality-assured test using the national treatment guidelines. Sexual 
partners of people testing positive should also be tested and treated, 
if positive.

Sex workers
WHO suggests that sex workers accessing health-care services who 
have no symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection be screened 
for N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis. Recommendations for the 
management of symptomatic sexually transmitted infections should 
continue to be followed.a
Remarks:
• This recommendation applies to screening with either a quality-
assured molecular assay, such as nucleic-acid amplification testing, 
or a rapid test with a minimum sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 
90%, where treatment is available. The anatomical site depends on 
sexual behaviour, and pooling samples can reduce cost and increase 
yield, depending on the resources available.
• Screening should be voluntary with informed consent. Treat for 
N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis based on the results of the 
quality-assured test using the national treatment guidelines. Sexual 
partners of people testing positive should also be tested and treated, 
if positive.

1. Introduction

Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections
1.1 Epidemiology and global targets
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a major public health problem worldwide, reducing quality of 
life and causing serious morbidity and mortality. STIs directly affect reproductive and child health by 
causing infertility, cancer and pregnancy complications, and they further indirectly facilitate the sexual 
transmission of HIV; therefore, in addition to affecting health, STIs also affect national economies and 
individual finances.
Chlamydia, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , and gonorrhoea, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae , are 
the two most common bacterial STIs and result in substantial morbidity and economic cost worldwide. 
WHO estimates that, in 2020, 128.5 million (90.0 million–173.8 million) new cases of chlamydia and 82.4 
million (47.7 million–130.4 million) new cases of gonorrhoea occurred among people 15–49 years old 
worldwide (1). The burden of chlamydia falls primarily on women, who have higher rates of this disease 
than men and among whom it causes pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal factor infertility and poor birth 
outcomes (2,3). The three biovars of C. trachomatis , each consisting of several serovars or genotypes, 
cause genital infections, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and trachoma (eye infection). Men have higher 
rates of gonococcal infection, but the complications disproportionally affect women and include pelvic 
inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility and increased HIV acquisition (4–6) .
Syphilis is a bacterial STI caused by Treponema pallidum  that leads to significant morbidity and mortality. 
WHO estimates that in 2022, 8.0 million (5.6 million–10.4 million) new cases occurred among adolescents 
and adults aged 15–49 years worldwide (7) . Syphilis is transmitted through sexual contact with infectious 
lesions of the mucous membranes or abraded skin, blood transfusion or across the placenta during 
pregnancy. Without treatment, syphilis can cause serious health complications, including neurological 
problems. Congenital syphilis results in a wide range of adverse birth outcomes. Global estimates from 
2022 indicate 150 000 early fetal deaths and stillbirths, 70 000 neonatal deaths and 55 000 preterm or 
low-birthweight births (8) . However, syphilis can be easily cured with treatment, and the risk of adverse 
outcomes is minimal if infection is detected and treated sufficiently early in pregnancy.
Population groups that are especially vulnerable to STIs include sex workers and their clients, men who 
have sex with men, trans and gender-diverse people, people who inject drugs, people in prisons, young 
people, mobile populations and people affected by conflict and civil unrest (1) .
WHO has set ambitious targets within the Global health sector strategies on HIV, viral hepatitis and sexual 
transmitted infections for the period 2022–2030 , including a 90% reduction in both gonorrhoea and syphilis 
infections and the elimination of congenital syphilis as a public health problem (defined as less than 50 
cases per 100 000 live births) by 2030 (9) . To achieve these targets, the strategy on STIs highlights the 
importance of enabling people with STIs or at risk of STIs to more easily access prevention, diagnostics, 
treatment and care.
1. Introduction
3
1.2 Rationale for new and updated recommendations
To reduce STIs and prevent complications, high-quality STI prevention and care services are essential. 
Many STIs are transmitted from people who are unaware of their infections, either from lack of knowledge 
or awareness of the symptoms and signs of STIs or from lack of any symptoms. This requires developing 
evidence-informed guidelines on STI treatment and comprehensive case management, including 
screening, diagnosis, treatment and care. Correct and effective treatment of people with STIs, ideally given 
and taken on the same day at the first contact between patients and health-care providers, is an important 
public health measure in controlling STIs since it endeavours to break the chain of transmission of the 
infection without delay.
Since the publication of the WHO Guidelines for the management of sexually transmitted infections in 2003 
(10), changes in the epidemiology of STIs and progress in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of STIs and 
HIV have necessitated changes in approaches to STI prevention and management.
In 2021, WHO published Guidelines for the management of symptomatic sexually transmitted infections  
with evidence-informed recommendations to improve the quality of STI case management of people with 
symptomatic STIs, including aetiological diagnosis and syndromic management (11) .
Syndromic management is widely used to manage symptomatic people with STIs. In most resource-
limited settings, the syndromic management flowcharts are still the standard of care, where laboratory 
diagnosis is not available or where available but results are not available on the same day. Although there 
are some shortcomings related to the STI syndromic approach, it remains an essential component of the 
management of symptomatic STIs. These guidelines aim to raise the quality of STI case management of 
symptomatic people with STIs by providing evidence-informed recommendations to address symptomatic 
STIs.
Many STIs, such as gonococcal infection, chlamydial infection, syphilis and HIV may be asymptomatic for 
many infected people, who therefore may not be aware that they are infected. The accurate identification 
of asymptomatic and symptomatic STIs depends on the availability of diagnostic tests and a screening 
strategy. Although high-quality diagnostic tests for STIs are available, they are often expensive, frequently 
labour intensive and, at this stage, often not suitable for use as rapid point-of-care tests.
Traditionally, diagnostic tests for STIs have been used to address STI prevention and control in the 
following areas:
• to provide a definitive diagnosis for aetiology-guided treatment;
• to provide screening services for asymptomatic individuals at risk of infection;
• to provide statistical information on the prevalence of various infections;
• to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of causative organisms; and
• to assist with the management of sexual partners.  
These areas remain important in supporting national programmes to know the burden of infections in their 
settings, to set evidence-informed targets for control of infections in their communities and to determine 
trends over time. To this end, WHO updated the manual on Laboratory and point-of-care diagnostic testing 
for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV (12).
1.3 Objectives
The objectives of these guidelines are:
• to provide evidence-informed recommendations on the screening of people with asymptomatic 
STIs, specifically N.  gonorrhoeae and C.  trachomatis ; and
• to support countries and national programmes in developing national guidelines for the 
management of STIs towards reaching the 2030 global health sector strategy targets on STIs.  
 
 
1. Introduction

Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections
1.4 Target audience
These guidelines are intended for STI prevention and control programme managers at the national level 
and for frontline health-care providers in primary, secondary and tertiary health-care facilities involved 
in treating and managing people with STIs. The recommendations and guidance are also important for 
health-care workers, including lay providers and community health workers, responsible for offering and 
performing STI services. These guidelines will be relevant for implementers of STI services, including HIV, 
sexual and reproductive health services and maternal and child health services. They will also be relevant 
to nongovernmental and community-based organizations, including those working with or led by key 
populations for the HIV epidemic, and service providers and users of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for 
HIV. The guidelines will be able to support the planning, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of 
such services, and be used as an advocacy tool in seeking the financial and human resources required to 
deliver adequate, acceptable and equitable STI care for everyone who needs STI services.
The recommendations are also important for people with or at greater risk of acquiring STIs, including HIV, 
such as members of key populations, people who use HIV PrEP and other vulnerable population groups, 
such as pregnant women, adolescents in settings with a high HIV or STI burden, indigenous populations 
and migrants.
1.5 Guiding principles
The following principles have informed the development of these guidelines and should guide the 
implementation of the recommendations.
• These guidelines will contribute to the achievement of key global goals, including the Sustainable 
Development Goals, and relevant national-level goals and targets.
• The guidelines are based on a public health approach to scaling up the provision of services and 
care for people with STIs, with the aim of reaching everyone, including vulnerable populations 
and key populations, with relevant interventions, including, for example, targeted screening for N. 
gonorrhoeae  and antimicrobial resistance monitoring (in accordance with WHO guidance).
• The adaptation and implementation of the guidelines should be accompanied by efforts to promote 
and protect the human rights of people receiving STI services, including preventing stigma and 
discrimination, promoting gender equity and ensuring that the use of services is always voluntary 
and never mandatory or coerced.
• The implementation of the recommendations in these guidelines should be informed by the 
local context, including the epidemiology of STIs, the availability of resources and commodities 
for diagnosis and treatment of STIs, the capacity of the health system and anticipated cost–
effectiveness of the various interventions.
• The adaptability built into these guidelines is intended to promote the accessibility, acceptability 
and effectiveness of STI services through public and private health-care systems, including at 
community health centres and other primary care facilities providing services for STIs, such 
as clinics for maternal and child health, antenatal care, family planning and other sexual and 
reproductive health services. As such, these guidelines should form part of a broader package of 
service delivery approaches, including linkage to prevention, testing, treatment and care services.
• The guidelines provide direction for acceptable and effective STI services for populations identified 
as being especially vulnerable to or at higher risk of STIs, including those living with HIV infection, 
and aim to improve health outcomes at the population level.
• The guidelines follow the guideline principles of the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, 
including to prevent the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance, parsimony, feasibility and 
alignment with the WHO List of Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine, including 
the WHO AWaRe (access, watch, reserve) categorization of antibiotics (13,14) .

1. Introduction
1.6 Structure of the guidelines
These guidelines provide evidence-informed recommendations for screening for asymptomatic STIs and are 
intended to become subsections of the forthcoming consolidated guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, 
treatment and care of STIs.
Chapter 3 presents the new and updated recommendations for the screening of asymptomatic N. gonorrhoeae 
and C. trachomatis among pregnant women, sexually active adolescents and young people, sex workers and 
men who have sex with men. The recommendations are based on the most recent evidence. These guidelines 
provide direction for countries as they develop national recommendations; however, national guidelines 
should also consider the local prevalence and health service capacity and resources.
Chapter 4 presents other existing recommendations related to the asymptomatic screening of T. pallidum 
(syphilis) along with implementation considerations for the management of asymptomatic STIs in Chapter 5.

2.1 Overview 
These guidelines were developed in accordance with procedures in the WHO handbook for guideline 
development (15).
The Guideline Development Group identified key questions about screening for asymptomatic STIs in 2020. 
A systematic review was conducted and modelling work completed. Evidence summaries were developed 
for each question and evidence assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
The Guideline Development Group developed the recommendations by considering the certainty of evidence 
for the effects, the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, values and preferences, acceptability, 
feasibility and resource needs across a variety of settings. Information on each of these aspects was included 
in evidence-to-decision tables, which were shared in advance electronically via the GRADEpro application with 
the Guideline Development Group for their feedback and used in meetings to support the judgements of the 
Guideline Development Group to make recommendations. Consistent with previous WHO guidelines, these 
guidelines are based on a public health approach.
The following sections provide further details on each aspect of the guideline development process.
2.2 Roles of groups involved in developing the guidelines
Five main groups were formed to guide and implement the guideline development process, coordinated by 
WHO. Each group played a specific role, as described below. Annex 1 lists the members of these groups and 
other contributors and their affiliations.
1. WHO Steering Committee. This group, which is responsible for the overall coordination of the 
guideline development process, was led by the Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually 
Transmitted Infections Programmes. Participants included other units and WHO staff members from the 
Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections Programmes, the Department 
of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research, the Department of Surveillance, Prevention and 
Control and the Department of Access to Medicines and Health Products. The WHO Steering Committee 
also included WHO technical staff members from every WHO region.
2. Guideline Development Group. This group comprised non-United Nation and non-WHO experts, 
health professionals and representatives of groups most affected by the recommendations in the 
guidelines. The 37 Guideline Development Group members formulated the WHO recommendations 
and good practice statements, including any implementation and service delivery considerations. 
They also reviewed and approved the final content of these guidelines. The composition of the 
Guideline Development Group represented all six WHO regions and was balanced across gender 
and backgrounds, including academia and research, programme implementation and policy and 
community organizations and networks. The members were selected in coordination with the 
WHO Steering Committee and WHO country and regional offices. The WHO Steering Committee 
reviewed curricula vitae, declaration-of-interest forms and confidentiality agreements. The proposed 
membership list was posted for public review and comment and then finalized.
3. External Review Group. The members were responsible for peer reviewing these guidelines, including 
the updated and new recommendations. This group was selected in consultation with the WHO 
Steering Committee to assure geographical and gender balance. It comprised 15 peer reviewers from 
academia, policy and research institutions, programme implementation and community organizations 
and representatives of networks of key and vulnerable populations.
2. Methods

4. External evidence reviewers and modellers, led by a methodologist. An independent team of 
external experts conducted systematic reviews of the effects of interventions based on the selected 
key questions for the guidelines. In addition, evidence on values and preferences, feasibility and cost–
effectiveness was compiled and summarized for each question.
5. External observers. Representatives of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 
(ECDC), the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP), and the United Nations 
Population Fund (UNFPA) attended the Guideline Development Group meeting as observers. These 
organizations have a long history of collaboration with the WHO Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis 
and Sexually Transmitted Infections Programmes.
All members of the Guideline Development Group, External Review Group and other non-WHO staff 
participating in the meetings and/or other guideline development processes submitted declaration-of-
interests forms and confidentiality statements to WHO. WHO reviewed all declarations, and no conflicts 
of interest sufficient to preclude any Guideline Development Group member from participating fully in 
the development of the guidelines were found. Annex 2 provides a full compilation and a summary of the 
declarations of interests. 
2.3 Scope and questions 
In December 2013, the first Guideline Development Group meeting was held to agree on the scope of the STI 
guidelines and to identify the different phases for developing the various components of the guidelines. In 
December 2020, Guideline Development Group met to determine the population, intervention, comparison, 
outcome (PICO) questions for the management of asymptomatic STIs. The populations identified included 
adults and other special populations: adolescents, pregnant women, people living with HIV and populations 
disproportionately affected by STIs, such as men who have sex with men and sex workers.
Specific questions were developed using the PICO elements outlined in Table 2.1, in the following format:
• Should screening [using strategy] versus no screening for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infections 
be used for [population] with no symptoms of an STI who are accessing health-care services?

2.4 Reviews of the evidence and modelling to inform guidelines
 
2.4.1. Reviews of the evidence
A systematic review of screening approaches for the management of asymptomatic STIs was conducted in 
PubMed up to July 2022 for studies published in English (Web Annex E). Studies of any study design reporting 
on outcomes (including acceptability, feasibility, resources and equity indicators) when screening people with 
no symptoms or unknown symptom status for an STI in low- and middle-income countries were included. The 
search for primary studies was updated in April 2024 in Ovid Medline and Embase for low- and middle-income 
countries and high-income countries in any language. Targeted searches for key guidelines published in high-
income countries were also conducted to determine the evidence supporting the recommendations.
Very few studies were found measuring important outcomes, and data were not pooled statistically across 
studies. Individual studies were summarized narratively, and if more than one study contributed data to an 
outcome the results were pooled as a range. Studies that reported the prevalence of an STI (not measured at 
follow-up) were used as input for a decision-tree model.
2.4.2. Modelling
A decision-tree model was used to explore the health-care outcomes and costs of screening asymptomatic 
individuals for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. The model provided a framework for considering the 
clinical and economic impact of alternative screening approaches for asymptomatic individuals in different 
populations. This is based on a model commissioned by WHO to inform the WHO symptomatic STI case 
management guidelines (see Web Annex F).
The model was used to explore different scenarios that included combinations of approaches for managing 
asymptomatic infections. This included no screening or treatment, screening with a laboratory-based nucleic-
acid amplification test (sensitivity 95% and specificity 98%), screening with a high-performance point-of-care 
test (90% and 95%), screening with a lower-performance point-of-care test (80% and 90%), screening with 
Gram stain and use of risk assessment before test. The impact of each scenario was assessed using several 
outcome indicators in nine populations. Web Annex B describes the assumptions in and structure of the model 
in detail . Briefly, the model operates in a static manner and therefore does not assess the evolving impact 
of screening initiatives over time at the population level. N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis are treated as a 
single entity in infection for testing purposes. The model assumes uniformity in the probability of symptom 
development and between infections. The probability of clinical outcomes between men and women, 
regardless of the infecting pathogen, is equivalent. Additionally, the model assumes that all people screened 
are treated and that treatment is successful.
2.5 Assessment and presentation of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence for each outcome from the review of primary studies and from the model 
were assessed separately using the GRADE approach based on the domains for risk of bias, inconsistency, 
indirectness, imprecision, publication bias, effect size, dose response and opposing confounding (15,16).
Certainty of the evidence for effects was assigned to one of the four grades of evidence defined by the GRADE 
Working Group:
• high certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect;
• moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be 
close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different;
• low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially 
different from the estimate of the effect; and
• very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be 
substantially different from the estimate of effect. 
Evidence summary-of-findings tables (also called evidence profiles) and the evidence-to-decision 
frameworks (tables to facilitate decision-making for the updated recommendations) were drafted before 
the Guideline Development Group meeting using the GRADEpro software (17) (see Web Annexes A–D for the 
evidence-to-decision frameworks for each recommendation).
2. Methods

2.6 Making recommendations 
 
Because of the complexity of developing these recommendations, several subgroup virtual meetings were 
initiated in 2022 to review the evidence. The Guideline Development Group subgroup proposed collecting 
additional evidence, including risk factors for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infections and asymptomatic 
and symptomatic gonococcal and chlamydial infections and to model the cost and effectiveness of different 
strategies of diagnosing N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infections in 2023. A series of virtual meetings 
followed to discuss the evidence and propose draft recommendations for the various syndromes.
A virtual Guideline Development Group meeting was organized in April 2024 to support the development of 
the recommendations. Before this meeting, the draft recommendations and evidence-to-decision tables were 
circulated to the Guideline Development Group via the GRADEpro application to obtain feedback. In April 
2024, the Guideline Development Group reviewed feedback, the evidence-to-decision tables and summaries of 
the evidence again to make judgements about the effects of the screening strategies in different populations 
and decide on whether to make strong or conditional recommendations for or against screening. The 
Guideline Development Group agreed by consensus, and there were no disagreements requiring voting. The 
recommendations and evidence-to-decision tables were finalized electronically via GRADEpro in June 2024.
According to the GRADE approach, the strength of each recommendation was rated as either strong or 
conditional. The strength of the recommendations reflects the degree of confidence of the Guideline 
Development Group that the desirable consequences (such as beneficial health outcomes) of the 
recommendations outweigh the undesirable consequences (such as adverse effects) and considers other 
criteria, such as resources, acceptability, equity and feasibility. According to this assessment, the strength of 
recommendations is graded into two categories.
1. A strong recommendation is one for which the Guideline Development Group is confident that the 
desirable consequences of adhering to the recommendation outweigh the undesirable consequences.
2. A conditional recommendation is one for which the Guideline Development Group concluded that 
the desirable consequences of adhering to the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable 
consequences but is not confident about these trade-offs (15).
Table 2.2 explains the implications of the differing strengths of recommendations for patients, clinicians and 
policy-makers. Remarks were added to the recommendations to explain the recommendation and/or describe 
any relevant conditions. Implementation considerations were added to provide further information for the 
possible application of the recommendation.
WHO then drafted the full guidelines and circulated them electronically to the WHO Steering Committee, the 
Guideline Development Group and the External Review Group for comments and feedback. All input was 
considered and the guidelines were revised. External peer review was completed in June 2024, and the text 
was edited, but neither of these processes affected the recommendations that had been formulated.
11
2.7 Managing conflicts of interest 
 
Managing conflicts of interest was a key priority throughout the process of developing the guidelines. WHO 
guidelines for declaration of interests by WHO experts were implemented. Declaration of interests statements 
were obtained from all members of the Guideline Development Group and the External Review Group before 
they assumed their roles. At the beginning of the Guideline Development Group meetings, including subgroup 
meetings, the members disclosed their declared interests and any new ones. Annex 2 summarizes the 
declaration of interests statements.
Eleven members of the Guideline Development Group declared interests. All were deemed to be able to fully 
participate since conflict was not related to diagnostics or screening of asymptomatic infections.

3. Updated and new recommendations
This section provides recommendations for screening for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis for pregnant 
women, adolescents and young people, sex workers and men who have sex with men, with no symptoms of an 
STI who are accessing a health-care service.
The recommendations are based on the combined prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis at 
the population level. For sexually active adolescents and young people, a high prevalence in a setting is 
suggested to be about 15–20% combined for both infections. For pregnant women, because of the adverse 
health effects on infants, a combined prevalence of 10% in a setting may be considered high. Decision-makers 
may have access to prevalence data from countries, programmes or clinics, which can be used to determine 
whether screening should be implemented for the population addressed in the recommendation. Note that 
the recommendations are intended to be applied based on population-level prevalence and do not involve 
assessment of an individual’s risk of infection.
3.1 Pregnant women
Summary of the evidence
Overall, the certainty in the evidence is low for small or moderate benefits and trivial harm of different 
screening strategies to screen pregnant women who have no symptoms of an STI and are accessing health-
care services for antenatal visits (see the evidence-to-decision table in Web Annex A). The evidence for benefits 
and harm was based on a search for evidence up to April 2024 (see Web Annex E for the systematic review of 
the literature) and the results from the decision model (see Web Annex F). We found a randomized controlled 
trial (18) and a non-randomized study (19,20) and used results from the decision model. Both primary studies 
occurred in low- and middle-income countries, where the prevalence of the STIs was 23% and 25%. The 
Guideline Development Group judged that there is likely little to no difference in premature birth and/or low 
birthweight between screening with a point-of-care test and no screening. Based on the modelled results, 
the critical benefit of screening (and where the greatest value was placed) is reducing the transmission of 
N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis to infants, which can lead to conjunctivitis or pneumonia. In settings where 
prevalence is high (such as greater than 20%), screening could lead to a significant reduction in infections 
3. Updated and new recommendations
Recommendation (new 2024) 
WHO suggests that pregnant women who have no symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection and are 
accessing health-care services for antenatal visits be screened for N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis 
in settings where prevalence is high and resources and capacity are available. Recommendations for the 
management of symptomatic sexually transmitted infections should continue to be followed.a
Conditional recommendation, low certainty in evidence of effects
Remarks: This recommendation applies to population-level prevalence rather than individual risk 
assessments, which have been shown to lack accuracy. This recommendation also applies to screening 
with either a quality-assured molecular assay, such as nucleic-acid amplification testing or a rapid test 
with a minimum sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 90%, where treatment is available.
Screening should be voluntary with informed consent. Treat for N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis 
based on the results of the quality-assured test using the national treatment guidelines. Sexual partners 
of people testing positive should also be tested and treated, if positive.

Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections
(about 25 per 1000 fewer). However, the reduction is smaller where prevalence is lower (about 12 per 1000 
fewer). There remains uncertainty about whether antimicrobial resistance may slightly increase (due to higher 
antibiotic consumption) and the long-term consequences of asymptomatic infections.
A review of the acceptability and feasibility of rapid screening and treatment of pregnant women with STIs in 
six low- and middle-income countries found that acceptability ranged from 85% to 99% and feasibility from 
91% to 100% (21). Barriers to access and acceptability include logistical barriers and knowledge about STIs 
and stigma (22). The Guideline Development Group agreed that screening is probably acceptable to pregnant 
women and feasible. However, the resources and costs of nucleic-acid amplification tests or point-of-care tests 
to screen are moderate, and these tests may not be available in some settings. The Guideline Development 
Group therefore agreed that there may be greater benefits over undesirable consequences in settings where 
the prevalence is greater than 20%, but where prevalence is lower, the benefits may not outweigh the costs 
and required resources.
Summary of the evidence
Overall, the certainty in the evidence is low for moderate benefits and small harm of screening strategies to 
screen sexually active adolescent girls and young women and young people who have no symptoms of an STI 
and low for trivial benefits and small harm for adolescent boys and young men (see the evidence-to-decision 
table in Web Annex B). The evidence for benefits and harm was based on a search for evidence up to April 
2024 (see Web Annex E for the systematic review of the literature) and the results from the decision model 
(see Web Annex F). We found a systematic review (23) of four randomized controlled trials and two recently 
published studies, one case series in a low- and middle-income country (24) and one randomized controlled 
trial (25). The prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis combined was 10.4% for males, and 20.5% for 
females in the case series in a low- and middle-income country and 20% in the model. The benefits for both 
males and females could include reducing transmission of STIs which could reduce their incidence, but there 
was no evidence reporting this outcome. For males, the Guideline Development Group agreed that infection 
may cause little to no difference in the incidence of epididymitis based on the modelled evidence (8 fewer per 
1000). For females, the model estimated that the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease may be reduced by about 
20 people per 1000, but the review of randomized controlled trials found about 2 fewer. The estimate from 
the model found that infertility may be reduced by 5 per 1000. The recently published randomized controlled 
trial found that prevalence may be slightly reduced (0.5%). The Guideline Development Group agreed that 
stigma and its consequences may be a small harm for both males and females. There is also uncertainty about 
the long-term consequences of asymptomatic infection or whether antibiotic resistance caused by greater 
3.2 Adolescents and young people
Recommendation (new 2024)
WHO suggests that sexually active adolescents and young people (10–24 years old) who have no 
symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection and are accessing health-care services be screened for N. 
gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis in settings where prevalence is high and resources and capacity are 
available. Recommendations for management of symptomatic sexually transmitted infections should 
continue to be followed.a
Conditional recommendation, low certainty in evidence of effects
Remarks: When balancing resources and benefits of screening, adolescent girls and young women may 
be prioritized. This recommendation applies to population-level prevalence rather than individual risk 
assessments, which have been shown to lack accuracy. However, exploring sexual activity in the past 
12 months prior to screening is essential. This recommendation also applies to screening with either 
a quality-assured molecular assay, such as nucleic-acid amplification testing, or a rapid test with a 
minimum sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 90%, where treatment is available.
Screening should be voluntary with informed consent. Treat for N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis 
based on the results of the quality-assured test using the national treatment guidelines. Sexual partners 
of people testing positive should also be tested and treated, if positive.
aGuidelines for the management of symptomatic sexually transmitted infections (11).
15
3. Updated and new recommendations
antibiotic consumption may be slightly increased with screening. The Guideline Development Group placed 
greatest value on the potential for reducing the transmission of STIs and adverse outcomes and therefore 
agreed that the benefits would outweigh the harm, especially for females.
A review of four studies reporting acceptability found that testing is probably acceptable, but there are 
barriers, such as cost, lack of knowledge about risk and embarrassment (24,26,27). The resources and costs 
of nucleic-acid amplification tests or point-of-care tests to screen are large, especially considering the large 
number of adolescents and young people that would need to be screened. Screening tests (molecular assay 
such as nucleic-acid amplification testing or rapid tests) may not be available in some countries, potentially 
reducing equity. Consequently, screening may not be feasible in many countries. The Guideline Development 
Group agreed that there may be greater benefits over undesirable effects in settings where prevalence 
is greater than 20%, and more so in adolescent girls and young women, who should be given priority for 
screening when resources and capacity could be available.
3.3 Sex workers
Recommendation (updated 2024)
WHO suggests that sex workers accessing health-care services who have no symptoms of a sexually 
transmitted infection be screened for N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis. Recommendations for the 
management of symptomatic sexually transmitted infections should continue to be followed.a
Conditional recommendation, low certainty in evidence effects
Remarks: This recommendation also applies to screening with either a quality-assured molecular 
assay, such as nucleic-acid amplification testing, or a rapid test with a minimum sensitivity of 80% and 
specificity of 90%, where treatment is available. The anatomical site depends on sexual behaviour and 
pooling samples can reduce cost and increase yield, depending on the resources available.
Screening should be voluntary with informed consent. Treat for N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis 
based on the results of the quality-assured test using the national treatment guidelines. Sexual partners 
of people testing positive should also be tested and treated, if positive.
aGuidelines for the management of symptomatic sexually transmitted infections (11).
Summary of the evidence
Overall, the certainty in the evidence is low for moderate benefits (such as reduction in STI transmission) and 
trivial harm of screening strategies to screen sex workers who have no symptoms of an STI (see the evidence-
to-decision table in Web Annex C). This evidence was assessed as applicable to sex workers defined as female, 
male, trans and gender-diverse adults (18 years of age and older) who receive money or goods in exchange 
for sexual services, either regularly or occasionally. The evidence for benefits and harm was based on a search 
for evidence up to April 2024 (see Web Annex E for the systematic review of the literature) and results from the 
decision model (see Web Annex F). We found a recent randomized controlled trial (28) and a review of evidence 
from previously published WHO guidelines in 2012 (29). Evidence from the 2012 guidelines included eight non-
comparative studies and one randomized controlled trial that reported HIV, N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis 
acquisition with screening provided in combination with other interventions (such as condom promotion, 
education and STI treatment). Most studies found reductions in the prevalence of infections over time. The 
more recent randomized controlled trial in a low- and middle-income country found that the prevalence of 
C. trachomatis was lower by 3.7% and N. gonorrhoeae by 0.7% with screening versus no screening. Other 
benefits for female sex workers estimated in the model included reduction in pelvic inflammatory disease (20 
fewer per 1000) and infertility (5 fewer per 1000). The Guideline Development Group placed the greatest value 
on the potential to reduce onward transmission of STIs, although this was not measured in studies. There 
is uncertainty about the harm (such as whether antibiotic resistance may be slightly increased because of 
greater antibiotic consumption or about the long-term consequences of asymptomatic infection). Overall, the 
health benefits of screening outweighed harm for sex workers.
16
Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections
Other factors did not change favouring screening in this population. We found a systematic review of 14 
studies in low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries assessing the facilitators and 
barriers to screening by female sex workers (30). It found that a greater number of sex clients or partners, 
awareness of STIs, trained peers and emotional support may increase the uptake of testing. Barriers may 
be lack of awareness of risk of STIs or of the availability of testing, time constraints and long waiting lists, 
cost, judgemental attitudes of health-care providers, stigma and criminalization of sex work. The Guideline 
Development Group agreed that screening is probably acceptable to female sex workers, but they may 
experience multiple barriers. The Guideline Development Group also agreed that the resources and costs 
of nucleic-acid amplification tests or point-of-care tests to screen are moderate, and screening may not be 
feasible in many countries that currently do not have these tests.
3.4 Men who have sex with men
Recommendation (updated 2024)
WHO suggests that men who have sex with men accessing health-care services who have no 
symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection be screened for N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis. 
Recommendations for the management of symptomatic sexually transmitted infections should continue 
to be followed.a
Conditional recommendation, low certainty in evidence of effects
Remarks: This recommendation applies to screening with either a quality-assured molecular assay, such 
as nucleic-acid amplification testing, or a rapid test with a minimum sensitivity of 80% and specificity 
of 90%, where treatment is available. The anatomical site depends on sexual behaviour, and pooling 
samples can reduce cost and increase yield, depending on the resources available.

aGuidelines for the management of symptomatic sexually transmitted infections (11).
Summary of the evidence
Overall, the certainty in the evidence is low for small benefits and trivial harm of screening strategies to 
screen men who have sex with men who have no symptoms of an STI (see the evidence-to-decision table in 
Web Annex D). The evidence for benefits and harm was based on a search for evidence up to April 2024 (see 
Web Annex E for the systematic review of the literature) and results from the decision model (see Web Annex 
F). We found a systematic review of 12 non-randomized studies (31), a recently published study of men who 
have sex with men using HIV PrEP in high-income countries (32) and evidence from a previously published 
WHO guideline (33). Evidence from the guideline included five observational studies in low- and middle-
income countries providing data for sensitivity and specificity of different tests and prevalence of urethral 
and rectal N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis but did not measure outcomes or the effect of screening. 
The systematic review found that the prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis at various sites was 
increased or unchanged in 10 and reduced in six sites over time with screening. Incidence was reported in 
the randomized controlled trial and found little to no difference (0.5 infections per 1000 person-days). The 
Guideline Development Group agreed that these benefits of screening may be trivial, but HIV acquisition 
and transmission to heterosexual populations were not measured in studies. Given the increased risk of HIV 
acquisition with STIs and the risk of transmission to heterosexual populations, the Guideline Development 
Group agreed that the benefits are small. Regarding harm, there is uncertainty about whether antibiotic 
resistance may be slightly increased because of greater antibiotic consumption and about the long-term 
consequences of asymptomatic infection.

3. Updated and new recommendations
3.5 Research needs 
To address the gaps in the certainty of evidence in effects of the asymptomatic screening of STIs, particularly 
of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis, more randomized controlled trials and/or hybrid efficacy and 
implementation science studies are essential, especially in low- and middle-income countries and among 
diverse populations. These studies should aim to measure how asymptomatic screening affects the outcomes 
of transmission, including onward STI transmission, HIV acquisition and transmission, adverse events 
associated with these infections among pregnant and non-pregnant people and their broader impact on 
incidence and population health. Implementation outcomes should also be documented as asymptomatic 
screening procedures are incorporated into clinical services.
Antimicrobial resistance represents a significant area of concern and should be given priority in research 
efforts to detect any rise in resistance among the pathogens being screened. Collaborative efforts with 
other sectors should also monitor antimicrobial resistance in non-STI-related organisms. Further studies are 
necessary to elucidate the role of asymptomatic STIs in transmission to sexual partners and the associated 
morbidity of untreated infections.
In addition, the development of low-cost, rapid point-of-care tests with high specificity and sensitivity is 
critically needed. Implementation research focused on the use of point-of-care and nucleic-acid amplification 
tests for screening is vital to optimize these approaches. Emerging testing technologies should be rigorously 
evaluated and incorporated into screening programmes in a learn-as-you-go approach.
When screening programmes for asymptomatic infections are implemented, gathering data on potential harm, 
acceptability and feasibility within various settings and populations is crucial. Moreover, research should 
explore the sustainability of these programmes, identifying factors contributing to the discontinuation or 
inefficacy of screening strategies, especially those that fail to achieve high coverage or reach the intended 
populations.
Two studies (32,34) assessed the acceptability of screening and found mixed reactions to screening: some 
wanted to treat infections and not prevent infections; others wanted asymptomatic infections treated. 
Evidence on the frequency of screening was also considered from a systematic review of 46 studies (35), 
of which none directly compared less frequent to more frequent. Although fewer people tested positive 
when screened every 2–3 months than every 4–6 months, confounding between the populations could be 
responsible for the difference. The Guideline Development Group agreed that screening is probably acceptable 
to and feasible for men who have sex with men. The resources and costs of nucleic-acid amplification tests or 
point-of-care tests to screen asymptomatic men who have sex with men are moderate, and screening may not 
be feasible in many countries that currently do not have the tests available.

Box 4.1. Existing WHO recommendations on screening for asymptomatic syphilis infection
Pregnant women (37,38)
• Recommendation: WHO recommends screening all pregnant women for syphilis at least once and as 
early as possible, ideally at the first antenatal care visit (strong recommendation, moderate-certainty 
evidence).
Key populations (39)
• Recommendation: Offering periodic serological testing for asymptomatic syphilis infection to men 
who have sex with men and trans and gender-diverse people is strongly recommended over not 
offering such screening (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).
• Recommendation: WHO suggests offering periodic screening for asymptomatic syphilis infection to 
sex workers (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). 
People with STI symptoms (11)
• Good practice statement: For people with symptoms of: (1) urethral discharge from the penis; (2) 
vaginal discharge; (3) lower abdominal pain (among sexually active women); (4) genital ulcers 
(including anorectal ulcers); or (5) anorectal discharge, good practice includes offering HIV and 
syphilis testing.
4.1 Syphilis
Syphilis is a bacterial STI caused by T. pallidum that is transmitted through sexual or direct contact with 
infectious lesions and organism penetration of intact mucous membranes or abraded skin, via blood 
transfusion or trans-placentally (vertically) from a pregnant woman to her fetus (congenital syphilis). Vertical 
transmission can be devastating to the fetus when maternal infection is not detected and treated sufficiently 
early in pregnancy. Syphilis, if not treated, results in substantial morbidity and mortality. Syphilis in pregnancy, 
if untreated, can lead to stillbirth, neonatal death, prematurity, low birthweight, malformations in bones and 
serious neurological issues. When untreated among sexually active people, the disease lasts many years and 
is divided into stages. Early syphilis consists of primary syphilis, secondary syphilis and early latent syphilis, 
and late syphilis comprises late latent syphilis and tertiary syphilis (neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis and gumma). 
Sexual transmission typically occurs during early syphilis. Syphilis also increases the risk of HIV infection, 
which is facilitated by syphilitic ulcers (36).
Syphilis diagnosis is complex. It is usually based on a combination of clinical history, physical examination, 
laboratory testing and sometimes radiology. Although other laboratory tests exist, serological tests are most 
commonly used to support diagnosis. Serological tests include treponemal tests that detect antibodies to 
T. pallidum infection and non-treponemal tests that use indirect markers of infection. Further information 
about syphilis diagnosis is available in Laboratory and point-of-care diagnostic testing for sexually transmitted 
infections, including HIV (12).
WHO has a number of existing recommendations on the screening of asymptomatic syphilis for different 
populations (Box 4.1).

5. Implementation considerations  
for the management of 
asymptomatic STIs
5.1 Definition of screening 
 
In the context of screening for asymptomatic STIs, especially N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, syphilis and HIV, 
the person being screened would be well and unaware that they may have an infection. Screening, therefore, 
can be defined as the presumptive identification of unrecognized infection or disease by applying tests, 
examinations or other procedures that can be applied rapidly to sort out apparently well people who probably 
have an infection or disease from those who probably do not.
Broadly, three types of screening exist:
• mass screening, with no selection of population, such as checking all infants for hearing problems;
• selective screening, categorized, for example, by age, sex or sexual risk for a specific infection; and
• multi-phased screening, performed periodically, such as annual health examinations. 
For STIs, depending on the infection being screened for, the latter two types of screening may be more 
appropriate. For example, it is generally accepted that C. trachomatis is more prevalent in adolescents 
and young people, and they would, therefore, be an appropriate target population for this pathogen. Key 
populations, such as men who have sex with men and sex workers, may also be offered screening for STIs 
including syphilis and HIV. For pregnant women, it is important to exclude syphilis and HIV or, if detected, be 
offered prompt treatment to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes and reduce risk of infant infection.
For pregnant women, the screening may be multi-phased and conducted in the first trimester and again near 
delivery to exclude, or pick up, any infection that may have been acquired in the nine months of pregnancy.
5.2 Rationale and objectives for establishing screening 
programmes for asymptomatic STIs 
 
Justifying the screening strategy requires that the infections in question constitute a significant public 
health problem in terms of the morbidity and mortality they may cause and should be amenable to effective 
treatment that is available and accessible and with a potential for cure.
People may have the most common bacterial and viral STIs (C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, HIV, herpes 
simplex virus and human papillomavirus) and Trichomonas vaginalis without symptoms. Some individuals, 
such as biological women, may have asymptomatic gonococcal and chlamydial infections of the cervix in 
about 50–97% of cases (40,41). In anatomical sites other than the urethra and the cervix, such as the anorectal 
and oropharyngeal sites, symptoms are usually minimal to absent in up to about 85% of cases (42).
Asymptomatic infections, especially in anatomical sites such as the pharynx or rectum, may be reservoirs for 
the selection of antimicrobial resistance when antimicrobial agents are taken for other conditions but at below 
the minimal inhibitory concentration for the pre-existing STI pathogens (43).
Since about 50–97% of STI infections may be asymptomatic, people with symptomatic infections represent 
the tip of the iceberg. Ignoring asymptomatic infections is imprudent since people who are infected but 
without symptoms have been documented to transmit the STI pathogens to their sexual partners (44,45). 
Asymptomatic STIs can cause significant ill health and mortality as precursors for cancer, including cervical, 
penile, anal and hepatic cancer. Further, untreated asymptomatic infections can result in an increased risk of 
transmitting and acquiring HIV.
22
Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections
Before a screening programme is introduced for asymptomatic STIs at the national level, there should be 
common agreement on the objectives of the intervention, the screening tests to be used, the populations to 
be screened and the pathogens to be screened for. Considerations on which populations (such as pregnant 
women and adolescents and young people) to screen will depend on the prevalence, the value placed on the 
outcomes of not screening (such as infertility among young women, adverse pregnancy outcomes or increased 
STI transmission) and the cost of the test. The populations for which screening is implemented should be 
known to have a high prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Screening may be cost-effective 
if it can target population subgroups at higher risk based on available surveillance data. The frequency of 
screening should depend on sexual exposure, the rates of partner exchange and transmission and the cost of 
the test. The frequency of screening should be balanced against the cost and the number of cases detected 
and the consequences of not screening. Based on the evidence for frequency of screening among men who 
have sex with men, fewer people test positive when screened every 2–3 months than 4–6 months, confounded 
between populations (34). However, more frequent screening costs more. Sex workers and men who have sex 
with men should be screened at least annually or every six months.
The main objectives of a screening programme for asymptomatic STIs are:
• to detect the infection at a stage when treatment can be given before the person develops signs, 
symptoms and complications; and
• to interrupt the chain of transmission of STIs and the impact on the incidence and prevalence of STIs in 
the community.
5.3 Ethical considerations 
 
Since screening is conducted on healthy people, the ethics of health care must be given priority. The following 
ethical principles should be observed:
• autonomy: in moral, political, and bioethical philosophy, people must have the capacity to make 
informed and uncoerced decisions regarding whether to undertake the screening test;
• non-maleficence: the principle of not causing harm or evil to people must be upheld;
• beneficence: the process should be conducted with the intent to do good; and
• justice: fairness must be ensured in how everyone involved is treated. 
People also have a mental risk associated with learning that they have an STI, especially sexually active 
adolescents. Minimizing social risks by ensuring the confidentiality of results is essential. In addition, sexually 
active adolescents, like sex workers and men who have sex with men, may be vulnerable to coercion and 
undue influence. Procedures should be in place to ensure that people from these populations receive proper 
education about screening and that informed consent is obtained. People with positive STI results should 
receive counselling from trained personnel. Adolescents should be counselled about the potential benefits 
and risks of disclosing their positive STI status and empowered and supported to decide whether, when, how 
and to whom to disclose their status.
23
5.4 Selecting diagnostic tests for screening asymptomatic STIs 
 
Screening tests are intended to determine whether an asymptomatic person has an infection that has not 
been recognized because lack of symptoms. The accurate identification of asymptomatic STIs depends on the 
availability of accurate diagnostic tests and a sound screening strategy.
The following guidance should be adhered to in selecting the tests to be used:
• validity: the test should be able to detect as many as possible of the infections in the asymptomatic 
state, to be determined by the performance characteristics of the test in terms of its sensitivity and 
specificity;
• reliability: the test should give consistent results with no random errors;
• acceptability and accessibility: the test should cause the least discomfort to the person and should have 
an affordable cost for the individual and/or the government; and
• the testing can be linked to care, treatment and follow-up. 
High-quality diagnostic tests for STIs are available but are currently expensive, frequently labour intensive 
and currently not suitable for use as rapid point-of-care tests. A screening strategy therefore needs to be 
established to determine the targeted population and the specific pathogens to be screened. In settings where 
screening for syphilis and HIV is already established, assessments should be made to determine whether 
screening for the additional pathogens can be integrated into that population.
5.5 Acceptable performance characteristics of a screening test 
 
To ensure the sustainability of a screening programme, the tests used should be inexpensive and easy to 
administer and should not cause discomfort that would deter the person from being tested. Further, the 
tests should be widely available and accessible to the target population. For the test to serve its purpose 
adequately, it should have acceptably good sensitivity and specificity. 
The sensitivity of a screening test is its ability to detect a true positive: correctly identifying an infection among 
everyone infected. The specificity of a screening test is its ability to detect a true negative: correctly identifying 
people who do not have infection.
The predictive value is the probability of having the infection given the results of a test. Positive predictive 
value is the probability that a person with a positive test result has the infection, whereas a negative predictive 
value is the probability that a person with a negative test result is truly free from infection. Predictive 
values are determined by the sensitivity and specificity of the test and the prevalence of the infection in the 
population being tested.
For a screening programme, the specificity is especially important to a health-care provider because a positive 
test reduces the likelihood that the person tested is free from infection. When the prevalence of infection is 
low, the positive predictive value will also be low, even if the test has high sensitivity and high specificity. 
Increasing the positive predictive value in a screening programme therefore requires targeting those at high 
risk of infection.
The sensitivity and specificity of the test should be evaluated against a gold standard or a reference standard 
test, and policy-makers should ensure they have this information before selecting screening tests for a 
screening programme. Currently, the gold standard for diagnostic or screening tests for STIs is molecular-
based testing, such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
A highly sensitive test for asymptomatic infections would mean that the number of people with asymptomatic 
infection who are not diagnosed by the test decreases. The test would pick up a high proportion of those 
infected but may also have some false positives. A highly specific test would produce a small percentage 
of false-positive results. For a screening programme, high specificity may be desired over sensitivity, 
especially when the costs of overtreatment need to be avoided, including unnecessary use of antibiotics and

24
Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections
development of antimicrobial resistance. However, as indicated above, the predictive values depend on the 
prevalence of infection in the community being tested. Nevertheless, since specificity may never be 100%, the 
tested person should be informed that a negative screening result does not mean the infection is not present 
but, rather, that the likelihood of infection being present is low. Similarly, a highly sensitive screening test 
is unlikely to produce false-negative results, and people who test negative on that kind of screening test are 
therefore very unlikely to be infected. However, false positives, even if fewer, should be borne in mind.
Screening tests should be reliable and reproducible. This is important when point-of-care tests are used for 
screening since the traffic of people being tested may be high and the tests may be performed in a rush or 
by different health-care personnel or self-test. The frequent causes of variability of results are usually the 
following:
• anatomical site from which the sample was taken;
• intraobserver variability because of the differences in interpretation of a test at different times; and
• interobserver variability because of variation of interpretation of a test by two or more health-care 
providers. 
Therefore, regardless of which test is selected for screening, training should be conducted, and standard 
operating procedures established covering preparation of the person and anatomical site to be tested, 
collecting and processing the specimen, conducting the test and how to interpret the result.
5.6 Treatment, antibiotic consumption and preparedness for the 
screening programme 
 
All people testing positive for an STI should be treated based on the national guidelines. In addition, since 
a screening programme should also constitute part of a prevention strategy, the sexual partners of people 
testing positive should also be tested and treated, if positive. Testing sexual partners ensures that all antibiotic 
use is rational and adheres to the principle of antimicrobial stewardship.
An effective and successful screening programme will detect more infections requiring more treatment options 
than previously obtained for the management of symptomatic infections.
5.7 Screening as an integrated prevention intervention 
 
Screening for asymptomatic STIs should be implemented as part of an integrated prevention intervention and 
not as a panacea for ending the STI burden on its own. In the general population and in any of the populations 
selected for targeted STI screening, other prevention interventions should be enhanced and scaled up to 
maximum coverage for impact. The prevention package for STIs includes the following interventions (46):
• information, education and communication activities aimed at fostering participants' knowledge of 
STIs and safer sex;
• use of male and female condoms;
• vaccines, currently for the human papillomavirus and hepatitis B;
• voluntary medical male circumcision; and
• suppressive therapy for genital herpes, which may prevent the transmission of herpes simplex virus 2 
(HSV-2).
25
5.8 Ensuring early and effective treatment 
 
All prevention interventions and screening services should be implemented in conjunction with accessible and 
acceptable STI services for treatment and care for the general population, adolescents and key populations 
and ensure the following in the process:
• promoting good STI health care–seeking behaviour;
• providing high-quality care for STIs, which ensures immediate treatment; and
• ensuring universal access to STI care for everyone who needs the services and thus putting the services 
to scale for adequate coverage for maximum impact.
5.9 STI services for key populations, adolescents and young 
people 
 
The adaptation and implementation of these guidelines should be accompanied by efforts to promote 
and protect the human rights of people requiring STI care services. This includes ensuring that stigma and 
discrimination are prevented in service provision while promoting gender equity and ensuring that the use 
of services is voluntary. Since key populations are disproportionately affected by STIs, it is critical to increase 
access to STI services for key populations and people living with HIV, including adolescents and young people. 
In many settings, people from key populations may not disclose their identities or behaviour, particularly 
in contexts where sex work and certain sexual activities are criminalized. Therefore, services should be 
designed to be accessible and non-discriminatory, ensuring confidentiality and protection from legal or social 
repercussions.
The WHO Consolidated guidelines on HIV, viral hepatitis and STI prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care 
for key populations provide recommendations and guidance (39). In addition, the following WHO guidance 
publications offer further implementation considerations for increasing access to and delivering STI services 
for key populations:
• Implementing comprehensive HIV and STI programmes with sex workers: practical approaches from 
collaborative interventions (47);
• Implementing comprehensive HIV and STI programmes with men who have sex with men: practical 
guidance for collaborative interventions (48);
• Implementing comprehensive HIV and STI programmes with transgender people: practical guidance for 
collaborative interventions (49); and
• Implementing comprehensive HIV and HCV programmes with people who inject drugs: practical guidance 
for collaborative interventions (50). 
Adolescent-friendly health services should be provided, ensuring that they meet the specific needs of 
adolescents through community-based approaches and training for health-care providers. Services should 
maintain confidentiality, privacy and non-judgemental attitudes to create a supportive environment for those 
seeking care. Additional WHO guidance on providing high-quality health-care services for adolescents is 
available in the following publications:
• Global standards for quality health-care services for adolescents: a guide to implement a standards-
driven approach to improve the quality of health-care services for adolescents (51); and
• Adolescent-friendly health services for adolescents living with HIV: from theory to practice (52).
5. Implementation considerations for the management of asymptomatic STIs
26
Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections
5.10 Antenatal screening for pregnant women 
 
The WHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience (53) recommend maternal 
assessments to detect various conditions during pregnancy. These include anaemia, asymptomatic 
bacteriuria, intimate partner violence, gestational diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, substance use, HIV, syphilis 
and tuberculosis. All pregnant women should be tested for HIV, as well as syphilis and hepatitis B virus, at least 
once and as early as possible during pregnancy (38).
In settings with a high prevalence of infections (exceeding 15–20%), WHO also recommends to integrate 
screening for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis into maternal assessments to prevent adverse maternal and 
newborn outcomes from gonococcal and chlamydial infections.
6. Disseminating and updating the 
guidelines
28
Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections
6. Disseminating and updating the 
guidelines
6.1 Dissemination 
 
These guidelines will be made available on the WHO website at https://www.who.int/health-topics/sexually-
transmitted-infections – click on “Guidelines” (there will also be links to other supporting documents).
WHO headquarters will work with WHO regional offices and country offices to ensure that countries receive 
support in adapting, implementing and monitoring the utility of these guidelines.
Every level of WHO (headquarters, regional offices and country offices) will work with regional and national 
partners – including the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), nongovernmental organizations and 
other agencies implementing HIV, STI and sexual and reproductive health services to ensure an integrated 
approach to preventing and controlling STIs. WHO will advocate that these external partners support the 
dissemination and implementation of these guidelines.
These guidelines will also be disseminated at conferences related to HIV, STIs and sexual and reproductive 
health and through electronic media. These recommendations will also be included in WHO’s forthcoming 
consolidated guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of STIs.
6.2 Updating the STI guidelines and user feedback 
 
A system of monitoring relevant new evidence and updating the recommendations in these guidelines will 
be established and mechanisms for disseminating the new information put into operation. Some of the 
mechanisms will be by electronic communication. An electronic follow-up survey of key end-users of these 
guidelines will be conducted after they have been disseminated for one year. The results of the survey will 
be used to identify challenges and barriers to the uptake of the guidelines, to evaluate their usefulness for 
improving service delivery for STIs and to identify topics or gaps in treatment that need to be addressed in 
future editions.

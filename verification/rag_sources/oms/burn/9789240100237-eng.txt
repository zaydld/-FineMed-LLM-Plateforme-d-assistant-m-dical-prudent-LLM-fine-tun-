Foreword
In the face of emerging challenges, the global health community continually strives 
to fortify its response mechanisms. The unrelenting threat of infectious diseases, 
climate-related disasters and conflicts, as evidenced by events such as the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic and conflicts, underscores the urgency of establishing resilient 
health emergency preparedness and response systems. The lessons gleaned from 
these crises must serve as the foundation for comprehensive guidelines aimed at 
strengthening both local and global capacities.
Just as Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) and the EMT Initiative have played pivotal 
roles in responding to climate-related disasters and infectious disease outbreaks, 
their expertise is indispensable in addressing the complexities that arise from 
mass casualty incidents (MCIs), particularly those involving burns. This publication 
embodies the collective knowledge and experience of the EMT network and its partners 
and endeavours to establish universal quality standards and recommendations, 
providing medical teams with a framework to rapidly and effectively respond to burns 
care in MCIs.
Drawing inspiration from successes in addressing climate-related disasters and 
highly infectious disease outbreaks, this initiative emphasizes the importance of 
robust national capacities. Countries are urged to swiftly scale up their deployable 
surge capacities and expertise, thus fostering a foundation for self-sufficiency. The 
Emergency Medical Team Initiative, through collaboration and coordination, facilitates 
the development of trusted partnerships and interoperable surge capacities on a 
global scale.
By offering a set of common quality standards and protocols, this publication lays the 
groundwork for enhanced interoperability among national, regional and international 
capacities and aspires to create a shared language and approach across diverse 
disciplines to further develop a comprehensive and coordinated response to burn care 
in MCIs. In doing so, it champions the mission of saving lives, alleviating suffering and 
protecting the most vulnerable during times of crisis. This publication marks a significant 
stride towards building resilient health-care systems that can effectively navigate the 
challenges presented by MCIs, ensuring a world better prepared to face the unexpected.

As part of their mass casualty or disaster plan, it is recommended that 
Member States include specific provisions for a potential mass burn incident.
Burn Assessment Teams (BATs) serve advisory, clinical and coordination 
roles while Burn Specialist Teams (BSTs) serve a primary clinical role.
Member States should consider creating a national BAT or having bilateral 
or regional agreements to request BATs from neighbouring countries as part 
of their national EMT system and their national emergency response plan.
BSTs may be best shared regionally among multiple countries, either 
sourced from one larger country, and/or with contributions from experts and 
resources in nearby countries within the region.
Medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) may be a subset of coordination activities 
requiring specialized clinical support. Countries must consider the inclusion of a 
MEDEVAC coordination function within their national coordination mechanisms.
While primary responsibility of coordination of EMTs remains with the 
appropriate national authority, during mass burn incidents, BATs and BSTs 
can support coordination at national and regional levels.
In the event of a mass burn incident, and when national capacities are 
exceeded or specialized care support is required, countries should consider 
activation of mechanisms for possible international medical evacuation.
During a mass burn incident, three phases of triage should occur: (1) on-
scene; (2) on arrival at the first receiving health facility; and (3) definitive 
triage after surgical scrub/wound cleaning.
On-scene, a standardized triage system for mass casualty incidents (MCIs) 
should be utilized, followed by a burn injury severity assessment determined 
mainly from percent total body surface area (%TBSA) burn estimation rather 
than depth assessment, as appropriate.
The %TBSA burn estimation tool utilized on-scene should reflect the tool 
most familiar to first responders. However, should guidance be required, the 
Wallace Rule of Nines estimation tool can be used for adults and the modified 
Rule of Nines for children.

TOPIC
Technical standard
Recommendation 
The decision to assign a patient to the “expectant” or “non-survivable” triage 
category should be made no earlier than when the patient arrives at the first 
receiving health facility.
For patients in mass burn incidents, treat with oral fluid resuscitation and 
where possible, supplement with intravenous (IV) fluid depending on patient 
need, clinical resources and provider discretion.
For patients in mass burn incidents, treat with oral fluid compared to no fluid.
For patients in mass burn incidents, give fluids as early as possible, on-scene 
or at a health facility.
For patients in mass burn incidents, use standard formulae for calculation of 
fluid resuscitation requirements.
For patients in mass burn incidents, no recommendation on optimal timing in 
calculation of fluid resuscitation requirements.
First aid for burns should include cooling, analgesia, cleaning, dressing and 
tetanus considerations.
Cooling of the burn wound can occur from 10 minutes to three hours after 
the injury was sustained using potable/drinking water at room or cool 
temperatures.
Basic wound cleaning includes removing debris and irritants from the 
wound. Advanced cleaning should occur on arrival at the first receiving 
hospital with appropriate analgesia and/or sedation. If further extensive 
cleaning is required, a surgical scrub can be undertaken in the operating 
theatre with anaesthesia.
Choice of dressing should be based on the characteristics of the wound, 
point of application, availability of dressing type, resource requirements of 
dressing and the ability of a patient to return for follow-up visits.
Tetanus vaccination should be up to date as per local guidelines and 
practices. Booster and/or immunoglobulin should be given as indicated.

Antibiotics should not be routinely given prophylactically to burns patients 
unless otherwise specifically clinically indicated.
Patients with < 20 % TBSA superficial/partial thickness burns and no special 
area burns may be discharged with adequate outpatient support, such as 
social and community support, with a clear care pathway communicated.
Patients with > 20 % TBSA and/or deep dermal or special area burns should 
be evaluated by an experienced burn care specialist as they may require 
ongoing in-patient care. Consider transferring these patients to a specialist 
burn care centre.
Procedures that may be performed by non-burn surgeons include advanced 
wound cleaning, surgical scrub, escharotomy and fasciotomy. Excision, 
enzymatic debridement, grafting, local tissue rearrangements, flaps and 
contracture releases are examples of procedures that should be performed 
by surgeons skilled in burns care and/or by surgeons supported by relevant 
clinical expertise.
Rehabilitation requirements should be considered for all patients (based 
on burn severity and location of the burn) on arrival at the first receiving 
hospital.
Active and passive exercises, positioning, splinting and functional retraining 
should commence at the earliest phase of care, once vital functions 
are stable and considering precautions such as related trauma, wound 
breakdown, graft frailty, attached wires, low blood pressure, or infection.
Adequate analgesia should be administered prior to rehabilitation 
interventions as pain can reduce participation and performance.
Compression therapy and massage should be used early to minimize 
scarring and manage oedema.
It is recommended that BATs and BSTs have the capability to support the 
initial care of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) patients 
in the event of a CBRN MCI.

1.1   Background
Introduction1
Health and operational support needs in emergencies have been well recognized 
(1). In recent years the world has witnessed improving professionalization and 
standardization of care for communities affected by health emergencies – a change 
which has been brought about in part by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
Emergency Medical Teams (EMT) Initiative (1, 2). The EMT initiative supports and 
encourages trained and appropriately skilled teams of national and international 
multidisciplinary personnel to deliver a coordinated approach to targeted clinical 
needs while adhering to minimum standards of care. 
The evolving nature and changing definition of humanitarian emergencies has 
highlighted the need for a widened scope of practice for EMTs and more specialist 
teams able to target specific health needs. With origins in climate-related disasters, in 
recent years EMTs have had an increasing and influential role in outbreaks, conflicts 
and other man-made disasters (3, 4). 
Smaller scale but high-impact emergencies, such as mass burn incidents, have 
highlighted a need for specialist EMTs. Burn injury frequency following a mass 
casualty incident (MCI) should not be underestimated. The nature of burn injuries 
often results in a protracted clinical journey for the patient, commonly resulting in 
long-term health consequences affecting functioning, quality of life and mental health 
(5, 6). Recent examples of MCIs with multiple burn-injured patients (Table 1) have 
demonstrated the extensive demands placed on health-care workers, health facilities 
and the overall health system – resulting in high, preventable morbidity and mortality 
(7–10). In one example, a study of 455 casualties from the mass burn incident found 
mean treatment cost was US$ 48 977 per patient (with total medical cost from the 
incident estimated at US$ 38.5 million), mean length of hospital stay was 63 days, and 
mean time to school or social re-entry was 39 weeks (6).  
Specialist burn EMTs are well placed to help target specific needs which arise, 
particularly in building local burn resource capacity and capability. However, these 
teams must adhere to minimum standards of care. Standard-setting has proven a 
crucial strategy for health-care system strengthening, improving both patient safety 
and quality of care, and remains a core objective of the EMT 2030 Strategy (11). As 
burn care capability varies globally, providing guidance to standardize burn care 
for mass burn incidents helps provide a platform for strengthening burns care for 
specialist EMTs, as well as health systems generally.

1.2   Scope and purpose
1.3   Document structure
1.4   Target audience
This document provides practical guidance for building capacity and capability for 
burns care from clinical, human resources and operational perspectives. Caring 
for burns patients from the incident scene to definitive treatment can be a complex, 
resource-consuming process with the potential to overwhelm health system capacity. 
It is therefore recommended that guidance in this document be applied to any 
contexts in which the local health system might struggle to cope and require surge 
support. The objective is to ensure the establishment and enhancement of specialist 
burn EMTs and surge capacities that are ready and able to deliver timely, effective 
and high-quality burns care in response to mass burn incidents, ultimately saving 
lives and alleviating suffering.
This document is intended to be an all-in-one, practical resource for the building 
and operationalization of specialist burn EMTs and surge capacities. It encompasses 
operational requirements (Chapters 3 and 4), technical standards (Chapter 5), and 
clinical recommendations (Chapter 6). The clinical recommendations chapter focuses 
on fluid management as this is a key aspect of major burns care for which certain 
clinical practice adaptations for mass burn incidents have been contemplated. As 
clinical recommendations, their development followed additional methods and 
processes in accordance with the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development, 2 nd 
edition (12) and the Guideline Review Committee. 
The target audience for this document ranges from health-care professionals 
and EMTs providing direct clinical care to burns patients to organizations and 
governments seeking to establish burns specialist teams. The document applies to 
professionals, teams and organizations responding to mass burn incidents nationally 
and/or internationally.

Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents
On 25 September 2023, a devastating 
explosion occurred at a fuel depot in Ar-
menia, resulting in a significant number 
of casualties. The Government of Arme-
nia reported 170 fatalities and nearly 
300 injuries. The majority of the injured 
were male patients with severe burns, 
leading to a high demand for advanced 
and specialized burn care. The National 
Burns Center, with 80 beds, was fully 
occupied. Eight other hospitals in Ye-
revan also actively provided care. The 
Ministry of Health issued a request for 
international assistance, specifically for 
Burn Specialist Team (BST) and medical 
evacuation (MEDEVAC) capacity. 
WHO, in coordination with the Ministry 
of Health of Armenia, established an 
EMT Coordination Cell (EMTCC) to en -
sure the smooth operation of EMTs on 
the ground, and the coordination of in-
coming teams and MEDEVAC activities.
Several EMTs expressed their willing-
ness to support Armenia in this crisis. 
An Israeli Burn Assessment Team (BAT) 
arrived in Armenia and concluded that 
there were 200 severely burned pa-
tients, with 60 of them in severe and 
critical condition. BSTs, including Israel 
EMT, Samaritan’s Purse, UK MED, and 
Italy EMT, in coordination with the Min-
istry of Health, deployed to hospitals 
where most patients were admitted. To-
gether, these EMTs performed over 500 
procedures, including escharotomies, 
skin grafts and surgical debridements. 
At the same time, discussions took place 
between the Ministry of Health, WHO 
and the EMTCC to identify how best to 
address the post-response rehabilita-
tion needs of patients, given the limita-
tions of the health system. As part of the 
EMT exit strategy, a specialized train the 
trainer course was held through a col-
laborative effort engaging the Ministry 
of Health, WHO, EMTCC and EMTs. Co-
ordinating capacity-building efforts as 
part of the exit plan of EMTs provided 
an opportunity to deliver a high level of 
training, resulting in a wider reach to 
health-systems strengthening over the 
recovery-filled months ahead.

The initial request from the Ministry of 
Health included MEDEVAC of burn pa-
tients as well as BSTs. A total of 19 pa-

with the Emergency Response Coordi-

pital capacity. Some of the countries

Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents
On 14 July 2022, a Russian cruise mis-
sile launched against the city of Vinnyt-
sia in central Ukraine struck a private 
civilian hospital killing 28 people, with 
over another 100 injured. Managing 
such a large number of severe burns 
patients, who also had other significant 
trauma-related injuries, placed enor-
mous pressure on an already overbur-
dened health-care system due to the 
impact of the war. 
The Ukraine Ministry of Health request-
ed support for the safe transfer of pa-
tients to the national tertiary level adult 
and paediatric burn centre in Lviv and 
beyond, into European regional spe-
cialized clinics. Artesans-ResQ, in col-
laboration with the Ministry of Health, 
conducted a rapid evacuation of these 
severe burn patients. 
Navigating patient transfers and evacu-
ations in Ukraine posed daunting chal-
lenges. Patient flow from the affected 
city to the medical evacuation hub in 
Lviv was uncoordinated, making prop-
er referrals difficult. Additionally, no 
available aeromedical evacuation ca-
pabilities existed. Consequently, hybrid 
evacuation strategies were devised, 
combining ground patient transfers into 
Poland to access aeromedical evacua-
tion there.
Addressing such challenges necessi-
tates an extended preparatory phase 
and the deployment of specially trained 
teams. Ensuring continuous safe pa-
tient care during transport becomes 
paramount, underscoring the need for 
standardized procedures and special-
ized training. This becomes particular-
ly crucial in the context of burn injuries 
where time frames for transportation 
are critical. The evacuation process also 
underscores the vital need for overarch-
ing coordination with clearly defined re-
sponsibilities, standardization of patient 
pathways and triage criteria.
Illustrative patient case
Following the missile attack, a 10-year-
old male sustained combined blast and 
heat trauma with extensive burns en-
compassing 65 % TBSA of 2 nd and 3 rd 
degree with his face, extremities and 
airway affected. Dislocated fractures in 
the left upper arm further complicated 
the situation.

The patient was initially transferred 
to Lviv by an ambulance team lacking 
appropriate intensive care capacities. 
Upon arrival in Lviv, his condition was 
critical and marked by inadequate re-
suscitation efforts. Four days after the 
initial injury, Artesans-ResQ conducted 
the first assessment visit in the paedi-
atric burn centre in Lviv. Advanced burn 
care was provided, including analgesia, 
fluids, dressings, intensive care, surgi-
cal procedures and nutritional support. 
The patient was later transferred from 
Lviv to Rzeszow, Poland via ambulance 
(a 4.5-hour ground journey) followed by 
a 1.5-hour flight to Dresden, Germany.
The patient underwent hospitalization 
in a specialized burn centre in Dresden, 
where he received intensive care for an 
extended duration of six months. Subse-
quently, in August 2023, he successfully 
returned to his home town in Ukraine. As 
of November 2023, he remains engaged 
in daily rehabilitation activities while 
also attending school. The overall out-
come of the patient’s recovery is highly 
satisfactory, serving as a testament to 
the kind of success stories swift medical 
evacuation in the context of mass burn 
incidents can achieve.

Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents
On 5 November 2021, a large explosion 
involving a loaded fuel tanker colliding 
with a truck occurred in Freetown, Si-
erra Leone. The resulting inferno killed 
over 101 people and injured more than 
450. The local township hospital was 
overwhelmed, receiving 82 severely 
injured patients and 87 corpses on the 
first night, with only three doctors and 
eight nurses on duty in the emergency 
department.
There were immense gaps in managing 
such a huge MCI at the national level. 
The National Emergency Medical Ser-
vices team and a disaster response 
unit were notified following the inci-
dent; however, the Ministry of Health 
and Sanitation did not harmonize coor-
dination well, resulting in further loss 
of lives as patients were not properly 
triaged at the scene nor appropriately 
transferred to facilities. Some patients 
were transported via buses, motorbikes, 
taxis and private vehicles. Most died on 
arrival. Nationally, there were few gen-
eral surgeons, only one reconstructive 
surgeon, no trauma surgeon and few 
emergency and critical care nurses. As 
there was no burns unit, patients had to 
be treated either in intensive care units 
or makeshift high dependency units.
The Government requested support 
from EMTs to augment available hu-
man resources and provide much-need-
ed clinical care. On 6 November, WHO 
requested assistance from BATs and 
BSTs, with the WHO Regional Office for 
Africa leading guidance and support of 
the EMT deployment process. The Gov-
ernment accepted early offers from the 
Mass burn incident in Sierra Leone – November 2021Spotlight

Italy BAT and Senegalese EMT. Having 
had a similar experience in DRC in 2018, 
the Senegalese EMT was mobilized and 
deployed 72 hours after the disaster. By 
12 November, 10 experts, including plas-
tic surgeons, anaesthesiologists, nurses 
and civil protection officers, had arrived.
EMTs were tasked to three different 
hospitals where patients were admitted 
to provide burns care, including recon-
structive surgery, pain management, 
palliative care, wound dressings, reha-
bilitation, physiotherapy and psycho-
social counselling. EMTs also provided 
on-the-job training to other clinical col-
leagues in burns management and pal-
liative care. Of 155 patients admitted to 
the three facilities, 87 were discharged 
home.
Daily coordination meetings effectively 
managed the activities of the local team 
and the EMTs with technical updates by 
the team providing briefings to senior 
management from the Ministry of Health 
and Sanitation. Constraints in coordina-
tion processes, such as the legal and 
regulatory requirements of registering 
EMT members with the Sierra Leone 
Medical and Dental Council to secure 
practising licenses to enable work in 
the country, hampered timeliness of the 
response and delays in providing care 
to patients. This experience advises that 
EMT members’ future credentialing pa-
perwork be forwarded immediately after 
they are contacted for deployment while 
other preparatory procedures, such as 
travel arrangements, are ongoing.
The EMT team dispensed their clinical 
functions with high professionalism 
and maintained flexibility in adapting 
to a chaotic situation and few available 
resources. Local community members 
showed great appreciation for the work 
done by the team and this was part-
ly attributed to having common back-
grounds, with the EMT team coming 
from a similar lower-middle-income 
setting on the same continent. 
For the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health, 
the response highlighted a need to 
strengthen coordination among part-
ners, with better provision, allocation 
and use of resources (both donor and 
government). It also became apparent 
that there was an urgent need to train 
health-care workers, set up national 
EMTs and establish a burns unit with 
support from WHO and other partners.

Methods2
The Technical Working Group (TWG) on Burns (2017–2019) conducted broad literature 
searches using key themes, including published and grey literature. Clinicians and 
experts from the global EMT community convened a TWG in 2017 to draft initial 
recommendations based on experiential practice and literature. Expert opinion 
played a major role in drafting recommendations. A draft document was circulated to 
the TWG and a survey subsequently circulated to the wider EMT community with a 
request to agree, partially agree or disagree with each recommendation, with space 
for comments. A second TWG meeting was convened in 2018 to review the updated 
document and attain consensus on survey results and comments. Another survey 
was sent to the EMT community and international burns organizations. A third TWG 
meeting was convened later in 2018 and the document updated.
Following both the development of a final draft of the TWG on Burns document from 
2017–2019, and routine WHO Quality Assurance, Norms and Standards procedures 
for development of WHO normative products (13), an external review of the final 
document was sought. Given newer global experiences in mass burn incidents and 
the recommendation to review new evidence under guidance of WHO headquarters, 
Science Division, Quality Norms and Standards Department, the external review 
group was expanded to a TWG. The TWG met virtually from 2021–2023 and updated 
technical standards on a shared document. This group evolved to become a guideline 
development group as it also sought to develop clinical recommendations.
The Guideline Development Group (GDG) 2023 followed the established standards 
and methods for the generation of trustworthy WHO guidelines as outlined in 
the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development, 2nd Edition (12), and Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology 
(14). This approach can be summarized as: development and convening of a WHO 
steering group; a GDG; an external review group and a systematic review team, 
including methodologists; identifying and managing conflicts of interest; formulating 
clinical questions; selecting and rating key outcomes (conducted by online survey); 
formulating values and preferences; conducting systematic reviews and evidence 
assessment; and developing and writing recommendations using the GRADE 
approach.

As part of their mass casualty or disaster plan, it is recommended that Member 
States include specific provisions for a potential mass burn incident. This portion of 
the plan would ideally be drafted in collaboration with members of the burn specialist 
community. Similar to other parts of the mass casualty or disaster plan, the plan 
should be tested with relevant local, national and regional stakeholders and regular 
simulation exercises conducted at least every 2–3 years. 
The mass burn incident portion of the plan should include: (i) type(s) of possible 
burn events and expected resulting types of injuries; (ii) response pillars, including 
coordination of EMTs; (iii) mechanisms to mobilize national teams/personnel 
(including ideally local/national EMT and BAT: (iv) mechanisms to receive 
international teams/personnel (including EMTs of all types); (v) approaches to care 
including communication pathways with transferring and receiving health facilities; 
(vi) specific provisions for possible requirement of MEDEVAC of patients within 
country or to other countries); (vii) written standard operating procedures; and (viii) 
resources available and possible sources for additional resources. Consideration 
should be given to the support and use of local and regional trauma teams (not burn 
specialized) and MEDEVAC teams, for example, EMTs specialized in MEDEVAC in 
augmenting some of the clinical work required. The integration of such teams is likely 
in the event of a large or mixed blast incident.
All countries should consider creating a BAT or having bilateral or regional agreements 
to request BAT from neighbouring countries as part of their national EMT system and 
their national emergency response plan. Should a country have few burns specialists, 
or prefer to retain these at the national referral centres, then BATs may be required 
from surrounding countries. BSTs may be best shared regionally among multiple 
countries, either sourced from one larger country, and/or with the contribution of 
experts and resources from nearby countries within the region.

Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents
3.1   Coordination
Ideally, coordination of an MCI should be led entirely by local government personnel 
experienced in operationalizing the coordination requirements as part of a health 
emergency operations centre. However, support is often required via external 
expertise to bridge gaps, support operationalization and help guide delivery. Thus, 
while the primary responsibility remains with the Ministry of Health or other 
appropriate national authority, coordination can be supported at a national and 
regional level by expertise from a BAT (see section below on BAT service provision). 
Mass burn incidents present a number of unique challenges regarding coordination. 
In addition to the influx of high numbers of critically unwell patients to overburdened 
health facilities, existing burns services and relevant resources in many regions 
can often be sparse and/or already fully occupied. Clinical expertise may only be 
available at the capital city or tertiary level health facility, and the number of clinicians 
experienced in burn care minimal. Focus of coordination should include strategies to 
decompress specialist centres and harness additional resources where available. 
Additionally, specific considerations must be taken for an expected large number of 
MEDEVAC patients from the site or country. MEDEVAC may be a subset of coordination 
activities requiring specialized clinical support. This can be a function established 
within the EMTCC structure, which is purposed to provide overall coordination of 
all clinical surge capacities and responding medical teams (both national and 
international) to best meet additional health-care needs. The MEDEVAC function 
within will be to support the coordination of medical evacuation, with experienced 
clinical and coordination team members to inform operation support and logistics 
requirements. Countries should consider the inclusion of a MEDEVAC coordination 
function within their national coordination mechanisms.
Since the overall scope of coordination activities required is often broad, the 
requirement for efficient pooling and tasking of resources is vital. BATs and/
or BSTs can provide an important resource in the form of technical and clinical 
expertise experienced in coordination and burns care who can help establish and 
strengthen coordination hubs. To ensure an effective response from EMTs and BSTs, 
coordination should be centralized and engage all relevant stakeholders, led through 
an established and nationally-led EMTCC. 
1515
General EMTs refer to the classic Type 1 (mobile and fixed), Type 2 and Type 3 teams 
that respond to conflict, outbreaks and climate-related disasters. Specialized care 
teams (SCTs) such as BATs and BSTs or for MEDEVAC, highly infectious diseases and 
spinal cord injuries, may embed into general EMTs or into local hospitals. Depending 
on their composition, expertise and infrastructure, EMTs may have the capability of 
delivering basic to intermediate level burns care (1). However, EMTs that are not 
BSTs are recommended to support the care of a burn-injured patient only to within 
their existing capability. EMTs may host BATs and BSTs should a need arise (for 
example, if local hospitals are overwhelmed or unable to support a burns response). 
This situation is most likely to arise when a mass burn incident occurs while EMTs 
are already in-country, or following an event resulting in extensive burn and non-
burn trauma injuries where there is a requirement for both EMT and BST support. In 
the presence of a BAT and/or BST, burn care capability of an EMT Type 2 or 3 can be 
strengthened, in a similar manner to the resultant increased capability of a local first 
receiving or tertiary hospital.

The role of BATs and BSTs are distinct but complimentary (see Table 2). The 
development of BATs is encouraged within all countries as a critical step in developing 
surge capacity for burns care.
BATs play a pivotal role in the early phase of a response (see Table 3 for required 
team members). It is recommended that the BAT be national and capable of deploying 
quickly and efficiently following a mass burn incident with the capacity to fulfil a 
number of roles and support the local health system in the following functions:
1. advisory
2. clinical
3. coordination
- Estimate patient numbers and their initial estimation of severity; and 
- provide a comprehensive check on resource availability in the first 
receiving health facility and specialist burn facilities.

- Support local health-care workers with the clinical (re)assessment, (re)
triage and on-going care of patients at the first receiving health facility;
- ensure appropriate and adequate early resuscitation of burn-injured 
patients, including analgesia, fluid management and escharotomy if 
indicated;
- provide support and guidance to local health-care workers in the delivery of 
surgical interventions for burn care, including decision-making, performing 
scrub and early surgical interventions (for example, early debridement and 
grafting);
- provide support and guidance to local health-care workers in early 
rehabilitation of patients; and
- support the care of patients receiving palliative care.
- If requested, provide direct support to local coordinating teams centrally 
(ministry of health or similar) and hospitals;
- support decision-making regarding patient transfer, patient evacuation and 
patient (re)distribution;
- assist local authorities to determine the need for additional expertise in the 
form of BST;
- liaise with local coordinating bodies to assist with patient and resource 
coordination strategies; and
- ensure weekly activities are reported to the relevant authorities throughout 
their deployment and a final exit report. 
4.1.2  Clinical function of BATs
4.1.3  Coordination function of BATs
4.1.4  Timing and duration of deployment for BATs
BATs ideally deploy immediately (within hours) following a request from the affected 
local health authority. BATs are not expected to assist on-scene and are best placed 
to focus their support centrally or at first non-specialist receiving hospitals, subject 
to local authority guidance. This mechanism also helps preserve the country’s burn 
expertise at their relevant specialist hospitals (those individuals who are not part of 
the BAT). BATs are recommended to remain in place for two weeks with integration 
into the BST, as required.
1919
4.1.6  Recommended composition of BATs
4.1.5  BATs logistical considerations
BATs should ideally be self-sufficient in specialized equipment, consumables, 
communication tools, food, water and habitat and also be self-sufficient for their own 
needs in order to perform their function for a minimum of three days. Mass burn 
incidents are unlikely to have damaged all local infrastructure, thus large caches of 
tents and logistical equipment are not required, so teams should be light and portable 
to facilitate rapid deployment. Self-sufficiency in terms of food, water and habitat for 
teams can be sustained through the use of local hotels and resources if these are 
unaffected by the incident, but the team should expect to be self-sufficient in terms of 
paying their own bills or have this covered through their deploying agency and not 
burden the local system.

4.1.7  Source of BATs
All countries should consider creating a BAT or having bilateral or regional 
agreements to request BATs from neighbouring countries as part of their national 
EMT system and their national emergency response plan. Should a country have 
few burns specialists, or prefer to retain these at national referral centres, then 
BATs may be required from surrounding countries. These would need to comply with 
international EMT standards, and be self-sufficient/self-caring for up to two weeks, 
but arrangements for such self-sufficiency in terms of team welfare is likely to be 
relatively easy to arrange locally, such as the use of local hotels and restaurants, 
without the need to bring large stocks of food and water. International BATs should 
be aware that they will likely be deployed into a hospital lacking burns service and 
therefore need to bring burns care equipment and consumables.
4.2   BSTs
BSTs are larger teams comprised of multidisciplinary, burn-experienced health-
care workers (Table 4 lists recommended composition). Whether nationally or 
internationally-based, BST’s have a number of important functions, not only in the 
clinical management of patients, but also in a coordinating role. 
- provide additional experienced personnel to provide support, advice and 
guidance to local health-care teams in the on-going clinical care of burn 
patients; and
- provide expertise, particularly regarding rehabilitation and long-term 
treatment plans for patients.
The main role of a BST has been recognized as capacity building, particularly for 
an existing health facility. It may be preferable to keep national health-care staff 
and expertise in their familiar place of work, rather than redistributing personnel to 
support other facilities – a role that can be supported by a BST. It is recommended 
that resource allocation be determined on a case-by-case basis, dependent on local 
context and resources, BST availability and type of incident.
4.2.1  Clinical function of BSTs
2121
BSTs are expected to deploy following an invitation from the local health authority 
after initial assessment by the BAT(s), which may be 48–72 hours or more post-event. 
International BSTs are not likely to arrive in-country for several days after the initial 
incident but should remain for six weeks. BSTs should support strategies to ensure a 
smooth handover of patients requiring on-going care and follow up.
In line with BATs and the minimum standards and core principles for EMTs, BSTs 
must be self-sufficient for a minimum of two weeks prior to resupply. BATs and 
BSTs are not expected to provide their own field infrastructure as teams are most 
likely to be co-located within an existing facility.
- Strengthen the capability of the BAT if required; and
- ensure weekly activities are reported to relevant authorities throughout 
their deployment and that a final exit report is filed.

4.2.6  Source of BSTs
BSTs are potentially less likely to be deployed, more difficult to put together (especially 
for long deployments) and may be best shared regionally among multiple countries, 
either sourced from one larger country, and/or with contributions of experts and 
resources from nearby countries within the region.
2323
4.3   Equipment and supplies for BATs/BSTs
As noted above, all BATs and BSTs are expected to be self-sufficient for their own 
needs and for the equipment and consumables required for the surgical and burns 
care they provide. 
Following an initial situational assessment by BATs, any additional resources required 
can be sourced and provided by tasked BSTs. Consideration should also be given to 
the tasking of other specialist EMTs such as those supporting logistics or medical 
evacuation. These may be requested by BATs or local health authorities should this 
be identified as a need. 
Recommendations regarding the equipment teams should deploy with are detailed in 
Table 5. A modularized approach to equipment is recommended. A modular system 
supports a standardized and simplified framework for burns equipment and expedites 
resupply. Thought should be given to the fact that burns treatment can continue for 
many months when considering stock volumes for each module.
The WHO Trauma and Emergency Surgery Kit (TESK 2019), WHO Major Trauma 
Backpack 2021 and other WHO kits provide several modules which may replace or 
supplement those below (15).

Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents
4.3.1  Infrastructure module
Since mass burn incidents are, in general, not likely to damage health facility 
infrastructure on a large scale, BATs and BSTs are expected to co-locate with an 
existing facility. Although self-sufficiency of burns teams is required, they are not 
expected to be self-sufficient in the same manner as EMTs Types 1, 2, and 3 having 
full infrastructure support.
However, there are exceptions to this and consideration should be given to required 
self-sufficiency in such instances. These include the following.
- Conflict: infrastructural damage may exist due to conflict, and conflict 
settings may result in thermal and non-thermal burns (for example, 
chemical) to a large population, especially if health facilities are specifically 
targeted.
- Climate-related disaster: in the case of a mass burn incident as a 
consequence of a climate-related disaster, local and regional functioning 
health facilities and EMTs (national and international) may provide an 
infrastructural platform for delivery of health care. BATs and/or BSTs can 
co-locate with either. 
- Radiation: gas plumes or other forms of contamination, such as radiation, 
may make it unsafe to use nearby health facilities and temporary EMT 
facilities may have to be erected in another safer area.
- Explosion within a health facility: surrounding health facilities may not be 
impacted and with external support, are able to provide needed burns care 
and facilities where burns teams can co-locate.
Consideration should be given to:
- airway equipment, such as nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal airways
- suction
- supply of medical oxygen
- oxygen delivery tubing, masks and cannulae
- equipment for advanced respiratory support, including intubation, 
ventilation and tracheostomy
- urinary catheters and urine collection supplies
- observation and recording charts
- WHO checklists.
4.3.2  Resuscitation module
2525
4.3.3  Dressing module
It is likely that the requirement for burn dressing equipment will far exceed the local 
supply in most settings after a mass burn incident. Accordingly, a dressings module of 
equipment should be available to be implemented as soon as possible after the incident. 
This module should include sufficient dressings, antiseptics and other basic equipment 
for undertaking regular dressing treatments on a large number of injured people.
BATs and BSTs should aim to augment laboratory equipment available locally. 
Information on receiving hospitals existing laboratory capability should be determined 
by BATs and equipment needed to augment laboratory capability communicated to 
BSTs prior to their arrival. 
Standard questions regarding the availability of blood transfusion services, basic 
laboratory, autoclave and radiology (chest X-ray in particular) are required. If not 
present, teams should consider bringing these capacities or liaising with local 
authorities to ensure they are on-site.
Quantity of pharmaceutical items should be estimated based on a two-week resupply 
and thus in line with recommendations for EMTs (1). Though it is likely that the 
requirement for analgesics and anaesthetic agents will exceed the local supply in 
most settings, adjustments can be made to quantity and items according to local 
needs. Logistical measures should be in place among burns teams to ensure cold 
chain transport is available if required.
Analgesics and anaesthetics
Consideration should be given to augmenting the analgesics and anaesthetics 
commonly used within local hospitals. This may vary across contexts. Transportation 
of any controlled pharmaceutical agents, such as opiates, must follow international 
custom and country guidelines. Provisions for safe anaesthesia care with appropriate 
monitoring capacity must be considered if anaesthetics are brought.
Antiemetic and gastroprotective agents
Consideration should be given to augmenting the local supply of antiemetics and 
gastroprotective agents such as proton pump inhibitors, especially for the critically ill.

Unless specifically clinically indicated, antibiotics should not routinely be given 
prophylactically to burn patients after a mass burn incident (16). However, antibiotics 
may be required to treat secondary infections. Teams should consider bringing 
appropriate burns-specific antibiotics to commence therapy in the case of infection.
Oral and intravenous (IV) fluids
A large quantity of Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) is recommended as nearly all burn 
patients will receive oral fluids. A supply of clean drinking water may be limited locally, 
therefore consideration should be given to providing bottled water along with ORS 
to avoid the need to boil water. Teams should also consider establishing a portable 
water purification system. This can serve as a backup if local supplies are insufficient 
or compromised, thereby providing a sustainable source of clean water for both 
drinking and medical purposes. Crystalloids are recommended for IV fluids, although 
consideration should be given to the logistics required for the weight and volume 
carried as deployed kit. Oral and IV fluids may be available locally, which the deploying 
team should try to determine prior to deployment and if so, their expiration dates, 
quantity available and storage conditions to ensure they meet required standards for 
medical use.
Tetanus
Tetanus vaccination is likely to be available in some quantity at local hospitals. Teams 
should also deploy with tetanus vaccine and immunoglobulin surge supplies if local 
stocks are unavailable.
Nutritional supplements and supplies
Nutritional supplements should form an essential part of pharmaceutical stocks. 
Recommendations include: multivitamins; zinc; vitamin C; supplementary feed options 
and a guide to calculating nutritional requirements in major burns (17). Equipment 
supporting a nutritional focus should include mid-upper arm circumference tape, 
weighing scales and hanging paediatric scales. Nasogastric feeding tubes and syringes 
are vital for delivery of adequate ORS, oral and/or enteral nutrition. Nutritional intake 
monitoring charts should also be considered.
Post-exposure prophylaxis
As per EMT staff safety requirements, teams are recommended to carry a short 
course of HIV PEP for team members inadvertently exposed. The choice of drugs and 
regimen for HIV PEP should be in line with established national and/or international 
guidelines.
2727
A blood module may be required. As part of their initial assessment, the BAT should 
help determine the availability of safe blood for use and confirm the likely need 
for deployment of a blood module. Procedures to reduce the risk of bleeding are 
encouraged, for example, the use of local anaesthetic with adrenaline.
Although a BST should deploy with enough personnel to technically support a second 
operating theatre, it is more likely that the additional team members will be performing 
a wide range of roles, including supporting ward work, post-operative care, out-
patient care, or second-assisting on complex cases. Specific considerations for surgical 
equipment should consider local capacity to engage in advanced wound cleaning, 
surgical scrub, escharotomy, fasciotomy, excision, enzymatic debridement, grafting, 
local tissue rearrangements, flaps and contracture releases, among others. Safe 
surgery checklists and patient documentation charts should also be part of this module. 
Plaster of Paris and other splinting materials such as polyvinyl chloride pipes should 
be sourced, as well as bandages to secure them in place. Pillows, rolls and wedges for 
positioning should also be considered.

4.4   BAT/BST training
All BAT and BST team members should have completed general EMT team member 
training followed by specialist training for burns. Team leaders and senior clinicians 
should also have training in coordination and emergency management. Specific 
training for BATs and BSTs should include:
- assessment, coordination and leadership in MCIs with burn injuries
- clinical care, including resuscitation and safe patient transfer
- decision-making regarding the management of multiple burn patients
- lessons learnt, best practices and WHO standards and recommendations 
for mass burn incidents.
Globally, utilization should be made of existing courses (see Table 6) which meet the 
required learning outcomes, ensuring training is regionally accessible, open access 
and economically viable. Training for BATs is recommended to be delivered at a 
national level. Training specific for BSTs can be delivered centrally at a regional level.
Training for teams in low resource contexts should be sensitive and responsive to 
local and cultural needs, relevant to the type of health-care professional working with 
burns patients and tailored to meet the basic, intermediate and advanced levels of 
burn care (18,19).

Burn-injured patients require timely and appropriate care from the scene of the 
incident onwards.
5.1   Patient flow overview
On-scene First receiving hospital Transfer/referral
Phase 1. On-scene: The scene of the incident and the site where first responders 
are most likely to attend to patients. First responders may include passers-by, local 
community members, emergency service personnel and health-care workers. Patients 
should be moved from the scene to the first receiving hospital/s by any form of 
transport available. Neither BAT nor BST should assist at the scene of the incident 
unless specifically requested. The roles of BATs and BSTs are deemed most suitable 
from the first receiving hospital onwards in the patient journey. 
Where applicable, a health post should be considered an extension of the scene.
Phase 2. First receiving hospital: This facility is ideally a district-level hospital 
although it may be a tertiary hospital depending on the site of the incident and 
self-presentation of patients. Existing burn care capability, such as the presence of 
experienced health-care workers, burn care beds and appropriate operating facilities, 
is likely to be highly varied; however, all are likely to have the capability to deliver 
basic burns care of pain relief, wound cleaning and dressing. Some district hospitals 
may have the capability of delivering an intermediate level of burns care without 
additional support from BATs and/or BSTs. 
To ensure early, appropriate and optimal patient care and support for local health-
care teams, it is recommended that all first receiving hospitals attain intermediate 
burn-care capability, as needed, with support from deployed BATs and/or BSTs. 
Phase 3. Transfer and referral: To target and utilize resources efficiency, referral 
and transfer of burn-injured patients should be viewed as multi-directional rather 
than a unidirectional “step-up” transfer from a district hospital to a tertiary hospital. 
Burn-injured patients requiring higher acuity and more specialist care should be 
transferred from the first receiving health facility to a tertiary hospital capable of 
delivering a higher level of burn care. Generally, these are patients with > 20 % TBSA 
burns and/or deep dermal or “special area” burns (see section on special area burns). 
3232
Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents
Consideration should also be given to decompress tertiary hospitals by transferring 
less severely injured burn patients (and non-burn-injured patients) to a district 
hospital to maximize specialist bed availability and preserve specialist resources. 
Decisions regarding patient referral and transfer are recommended to occur only after 
definitive triage has been undertaken by the first receiving hospital (with support from 
BATs and/or BSTs, as required). The burn care provision of a receiving health facility 
can be strengthened by incoming BATs and/or BSTs who can support the scale up of 
resources required to manage a large influx of patients while maintaining adequate 
level of burn care capability (Table 7).
Any transfer of a patient between hospitals should only occur once the patient is 
clinically stable and there has been appropriate communication between the referring 
and receiving hospital. Support from a central coordination hub may also be required.

A three-phased triage approach is important, in part to ensure accurate patient 
assessment following an evolving injury, but also to ensure patients are provided 
the most suitable interventions for their burn injury in a timely manner. The three-
phase triage approach also helps target limited national and international resources 
to needs, such as specialist beds and intensive care. 
5.2.1  On-scene at site of incident
The first phase of triage occurs at the site of the incident. The first responder pool will 
vary in their experience of assessing injured patients and thus guidance should be 
familiar, simple and practical in its approach. BATs may support this as requested by 
local authorities.
General triage
Existing and conventional triage systems such as the WHO/ICRC/MSF/IFRC Integrated 
Interagency Triage Tool (20) or other standardized tools such as the Simple Triage And 
Rapid Treatment (START) (21) system should be applied to identify life-threatening 
injuries such as those compromising the airway (including inhalational burns, head 
and neck injuries), breathing (such as circumferential full thickness chest burns) or 
circulation (such as those causing massive haemorrhage). Patients are assigned an 
appropriate triage category according to the tool used.
The decision to assign a patient to the “expectant” or “non-survivable” or similar 
triage category is often difficult and sensitive within cultures and communities. Due to 
the dynamic nature of burn size  estimation and potential on-scene estimation error, 
5.2   Triage
Triage is a dynamic process and will likely occur multiple times for the same patient, 
especially in an MCI. In MCIs, both trauma and/or burns may result and thus a rapid 
assessment and triage of injuries is required.
 In general, three phases of triage are suggested to occur:
On-scene On-arrival Definitive
5  Technical standards
3434
Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents
decision-making regarding survivability of a burn injury is recommended to occur at 
the first receiving health facility, ideally under expert guidance rather than on-scene.

The decision to assign a patient to the “expectant” or “non-survivable” or similar

the dynamic nature of burn size  estimation and potential on-scene estimation error, 
decision-making regarding survivability of a burn injury is recommended to occur at 
the first receiving health facility, ideally under expert guidance rather than on-scene. 
Burn specific triage: %TBSA burn estimation
Following conventional triage, assessment of burn severity can occur. On-scene 
assessment of burn severity should be determined mainly from %TBSA burn size 
estimation rather than depth assessment.
Estimation of %TBSA burn at scene supports a simple but early effective approach 
to initial burn triage. Mortality from burns is multifactorial although the relationship 
between %TBSA burn and survival is well known (22). Depth should not be used as a 
severity assessment factor as scene responders may not be experienced nor trained 
in burn injury depth assessment. Additionally, the depth of a burn changes over time 
and can be difficult to assess even by burns specialists in the first 24 hours (23).  Over 
and underestimation of %TBSA burn is likely to occur on-scene, and environmental 
and cultural constraints may impact on how easily burn size estimation can occur (24). 
A 2019 systematic literature review identified %TBSA burn miscalculations from 5 % 
to 339 % regardless of provider level with < 20 % TBSA burns being disproportionately 
overestimated (25). Thus, reassessment and re-triage on arrival at the first receiving 
hospital, and subsequently by burn-experienced staff, is essential. 
3535
The %TBSA burn size estimation tool utilized on scene should reflect the tool most 
familiar to the first responder. This is likely to reduce error and support an easy-
to-use assessment for first responders to determine %TBSA burn. However, should 
guidance be required, the Wallace Rule of Nines %TBSA burn estimation tool should 
be used for adults (with the accompanying modified version for children) (26). This 
method is simple, applicable across a variety of contexts, and is a commonly used 
burn size estimation tool used in pre-hospital environments (27). On arrival at the first 
receiving health facility, additional tools and burn-experienced health-care workers 
may be available to re-estimate %TBSA burn as part of the overall reassessment and 
triage of the patient.
For an approach to further simplify %TBSA-based burn specific triage (which occurs 
only after general triage as appropriate), the guide below in Table 8 may be considered, 
taking into account additional special considerations such as age of the patient.

5.2.2  On-arrival at first receiving health facility 
The second phase of triage is recommended to occur at the first receiving facility 
immediately on patient arrival. BATs and/or BSTs are well placed to support both 
arrival and definitive triage. 
On-arrival triage supports a re-evaluation of each patient with consideration given 
to survivability factors such as %TBSA burn, age, depth and site of burn, and patient 
comorbidities (Table 9). Burn size %TBSA recalculation at this stage may be completed 
using additional tools. 
It should be noted that across all contexts paediatric burns are routinely difficult to 
assess and may result in over-estimation of burn size by the first receiving hospital 
compared to a specialist burns unit thus impacting transfer decisions (28). Regular 
reassessment and re-triage supported by burns expertise is critical.
Table 9.  Factors to consider during on-arrival and definitive triage
-  %TBSA burn
-  Depth of burn
-  Site of burn
-  Age of patient
-  Comorbidities
-  Resource availability
-  Systems infrastructure: availability of specialist burns bed; 
    capacity at national burns centres
-  Accessibility to skilled burn care clinicians.
On arrival at the first receiving health facility the decision to assign a patient to the 
“Expectant” or “Non-survivable” or similar triage category remains difficult and 
sensitive. Support for such decision-making is recommended and can be offered by 
the BAT and/or BST. Once a decision has been made by the treating health-care team, 
implementation of palliative care interventions (see Table 10) is essential to ensure 
the patient’s dignity and comfort. Consideration should also be given to the needs of 
the patient’s family. 
Patients with non-survivable injuries should be nursed at the health facility where 
they have been initially received. However, this decision should be at the discretion 
of the treating clinicians and may be influenced by availability of nursing care and 
locality of patient family.

-  analgesia
-  simple dressings
-  oral fluids
-  catheter
-  vector control interventions (for example, mosquito nets)
-  mental health and bereavement support.
Minimum provision of palliative care should include:
5.2.3  Definitive (after surgical scrub/wound cleaning)
The third phase of triage should also be undertaken at the first receiving health facility. 
Definitive triage should occur after extensive wound cleaning and/or surgical scrub, 
meaning when the extent, site and severity of burn injuries can be more accurately 
determined. BATs and/or BSTs are well placed to support both arrival and definitive 
triage.
A three-phased triage approach is important in part to ensure accurate patient 
assessment following an evolving injury, but also to ensure patients are provided with 
the most suitable interventions for their burn injury in a timely manner. The three-
phase triage approach also helps in timely recruitment of national and international 
resources to appropriately deal with higher-care resource needs such as specialist 
beds and intensive care.
On-arrival and definitive triage should include an assessment of burn depth. Other 
survivability factors including patient age and comorbidities should also be considered 
during these phases of triage (Table 9). Decisions regarding onward clinical care 
and redistribution of patients can then be considered once a more accurate patient 
assessment has been completed. Paediatric burns > 10 % TBSA (determined after 
definitive triage), inhalational burns, special area burns and specific chemical burns 
should be triaged and managed in a tertiary hospital when possible.
5  Technical standards
3838
Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents
5.3   Special area burns
Burns affecting the face, neck, perineum, genitalia, joints, hands and feet are designated 
special area burns. Burn expertise with BAT and/or BST support may be required 
to manage patients sustaining these kinds of burn injuries, regardless of %TBSA 
affected. Access of such patients to specialist care (such as rehabilitation specialists) 
is recommended to expedite and optimize recovery.
5.4   Inhalation injury
Inhalational injuries can cause significant morbidity and mortality (29). Early recognition 
and intervention of likely airway compromise or respiratory failure is an important 
step towards improving patient outcome. First responders and those at the initial 
receiving health facility are advised to be observant for early signs and symptoms of 
a thermal inhalational injury. The type of incident and mechanism of a burn injury will 
also provide additional indications of the risk of inhalational injury. Signs of inhalational 
injury include soot in the mouth, facial burns, stridor, hoarseness and confusion (29). 
Evaluation of inhalational injury is a critical step in the triage process.
Consideration should also be given to the possibility of chemical inhalational injuries, 
such as those resulting from mustard gas, phosphorus and chlorine following MCIs. 
Appropriate personal protective equipment is advised when managing patients 
suspected of being victims of a chemical incident. Additionally, awareness of the often 
delayed effects of the agent is important (for example, mustard agents) (30). Industrial 
accidents can also give rise to inhalational injuries such as cyanide poisoning from 
acrylics (31).
Early and appropriate interventions and referral of patients with suspected 
inhalational injuries to specialized burn centres can help support improved outcome. 
Early interventions include airway protection, oxygenation, cautious fluid management 
and respiratory rehabilitation. 
Respiratory complications from inhalation injuries affect each patient differently. 
These may include: pain, anxiety, increased work of breathing and secretion retention. 
Early respiratory rehabilitation and optimal early patient positioning can help 
alleviate symptoms and prevent future complications in addition to ensuring the 
patient is equipped to manage their symptoms on discharge. Where possible, early 
3939
mobilization should be encouraged to enable the patient to clear secretions and 
maintain cardiorespiratory system function. For children, this may take the form of 
play. A programme of breathing exercises and manual techniques should be used to 
support the patient to maximize lung function and chest expansion.
Advanced airway management (intubation and ventilation) is resource intense and 
thus this intervention should be considered at the earliest possible phase of care.
5.5   First aid and dressings
First aid for burn injury influences the clinical course and severity of the burn (32–34). 
Basic first aid can be continued from on-scene into the first receiving hospital and 
includes the following.
5.5.1  Cooling
Cooling of the burn wound can occur from 10 minutes to three hours after the injury 
was sustained using potable/drinking water of room or cool temperature. Cooling is 
associated with improvement in re-epithelialization over the first two weeks post-
burn and decreased scar tissue at six weeks (33, 35). Consideration should be given 
to patients who are at risk of hypothermia, in which cases resuscitation efforts should 
be prioritized over burn cooling.
5.5.2  Analgesia 
Provision of pain relief is critical for patients with burn injuries and should be offered 
in conjunction with cooling and/or just before cleaning if possible.
5.5.3  Cleaning
Basic cleaning involves removing debris and irritants from the wound using potable/
drinking water of room or cool temperature. Rings, watches or any other jewellery/
clothing should be removed from the burned area as swelling will ensue.
Advanced (thorough) cleaning should occur on arrival at the first receiving hospital 
with appropriate analgesia and/or sedation. 
5  Technical standards
4040
Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents
5.5.4  Dressing
A basic non-circumferential, light, clean dressing or plastic wrap may be applied after 
basic cleaning. Application of substances such as eggs, butter, toothpaste or similar 
should be avoided.
More extensive understanding of the pathophysiology of wound healing and 
developments in dressing technology has resulted in significant advances in burn 
wound care and dressings (36). There are a number of modernized dressings available 
that are designed to be left in place for a longer duration than simple daily or alternate 
day dressings. However, the former may be considerably more expensive. 
After wound cleaning, options for dressings should be considered according to:
(a) the wound characteristics (for example, infected versus non-infected); 
(b) point of application (on-scene or health facility); 
(c) availability of dressings, including routine dressings and/or specialist 
     dressings likely to be externally sourced; 
(d) cost-benefit implications and resource requirements (such as staffing); and 
(e) ability of patient to return for follow up.
In a mass burn incident, availability of staff to regularly change dressings and 
dressing availability (potentially affected by lack of local and international resupply) 
are likely to be compromised. Consideration also needs to be given to the logistical 
requirement of transporting dressings if brought to the health facility by a BAT and/
or BST, including packaging weight and volume, air transport costs, clinical waste 
disposal requirements and local transportation.
5.5.5  Tetanus considerations
Confirm if a patient has had their tetanus vaccination and it is up to date as per local 
guidelines and practices. Give booster and/or immunoglobulin as indicated.
If extensive wound cleaning is required, the surgical scrub of burn wounds can 
be undertaken in the operating theatre by clinicians while the patient is under 
anaesthesia. This intervention can be supported by burn experts from the BAT and/
or BST.
4141
5.6   Out-patient burn management
Effective out-patient care of the burn-injured patient requires patient compliance 
and adherence to treatment. Clear communication, easily accessible clinics and 
simple burn care pathways should be made available to patients and their families. 
Community engagement in burn care and burn prevention is also important and helps 
provide support for patient recovery. 
Patients with < 20 % TBSA superficial/partial thickness burns and no special area 
burns may be discharged with adequate outpatient support (for example, social and 
community support and clear care pathway communicated).
Patients with > 20 % TBSA and/or deep dermal or special area burns should be 
evaluated by an experienced burn care specialist as they may require ongoing in-
patient care. Consider transferring these patients to a specialist burn care centre.
5.7   Surgical interventions
Surgical interventions that the local surgical teams are unfamiliar with or inexperienced 
in should be supported by clinical expertise from BAT and/or BST, supplementing the 
use of existing procedural guidance and checklists.
Procedures that may be performed by non-burn surgeons include advanced wound 
cleaning, surgical scrub, escharotomy and fasciotomy. As limb-salvaging and life-
saving interventions, escharotomies and/or fasciotomies are deemed to be an 
important part of the initial management and stabilization approach to burn patients. 
These may be performed at a first receiving hospital provided infrastructure and local 
skill sets are available.
Excision, enzymatic debridement, grafting, local tissue rearrangements, flaps and 
contracture releases are examples of procedures that should be performed by 
surgeons skilled in burns care and/or by surgeons supported by clinical expertise. 
Full thickness burns should ideally be managed (excised) within the first week of 
injury while partial thickness may be managed beyond the first week. Excisions of 
burns < 20 % TBSA in adults and < 10 % in children may be may be performed at a first 
receiving hospital, supported by burns expertise, provided infrastructure and local 
skill sets are available. Only skilled burn surgeons (supporting a district or tertiary 
hospital) should undertake excision in patients with > 20 % TBSA burn (adult) and 
> 10 % TBSA burn (children).
5  Technical standards
4242
Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents
5.8   Rehabilitation
Early access to rehabilitation can have a significant impact on patient outcomes and 
reduce the risk of secondary complications, such as immobility and contractures. The 
hypermetabolic response from severe burns, coupled with prolonged bed rest make 
patients vulnerable to secondary complications (37, 38). This is especially critical in the 
context of limited in-patient bed availability during a mass burn incident.
Active and passive exercises, positioning, splinting and functional retraining should 
commence at the earliest phase of care, once vital functions are stable and considering 
precautions such as related trauma, wound breakdown, graft frailty, attached wires, 
low blood pressure or infection. Adequate analgesia should be administered prior to 
rehabilitation interventions as pain can reduce participation and performance.
In the context of burn injuries, the focus of rehabilitation is on:
-  reducing oedema
-  managing pain
-  encouraging early mobilization
-  preventing or reducing disfigurement 
-  supporting functional recovery 
-  minimizing the impact of scarring on range of movement.
Rehabilitation specialists have specific skills to target these objectives. Rehabilitation 
specialists are potentially also well-suited to take over the care of burns patients 
once surgical intervention and wound care has been completed. However, improving 
patient outcomes from burn injury through effective rehabilitation strategies remains 
the responsibility of the entire treating team in collaboration with the patient (39). 
Rehabilitation requirements should be considered for all patients (based on burn 
severity and location of the burn) on their arrival at the first receiving hospital. 
Depending on need, rehabilitation interventions may include:
 -  respiratory physiotherapy (see section on inhalation injuries)
 -  stretching and range of movement exercises 
 -  strength and coordination exercises
 -  ambulation
 -  activity of daily living/functional retraining 
 -  anti-contracture positioning.
4343
Burn contractures can develop within weeks. Splinting and positioning are essential 
for maintaining tissue length during wound healing and to maximize functioning. 
Oedema post-burn injury can be aggravated by limb dependency and can restrict wound 
healing and movement, as well as exacerbate pain (40). Elevated positioning facilitates 
lymphatic drainage and, along with massage and compression, can be used to effectively 
manage oedema. When burns are grafted or deep partial or full thickness burns are 
being managed expectantly, position the burnt/grafted skin to counteract contractile 
forces, using splints when indicated, to prevent contracture and manage oedema.
-  Splinting
Splinting can be used post-skin grafting to immobilize the limb. The typical 
regime post-skin graft is to continually immobilize the affected joint area(s) 
for five to seven days (depending on the state of the graft take), followed by 
night-wear of splints. However, this should be decided in consultation with 
the surgeon. Splints may be applied in theatre while the patient is under 
anaesthesia or during post-operative recovery to minimize discomfort. The 
indication for splinting is based on the severity and location of the burn, 
and the patient’s ability to move actively. Splinting should be particularly 
considered for young children and sedated patients who may not be able 
to actively participate in stretching and exercises. Photographs or pictures 
can be used to illustrate ideal positioning.
Splinting and anti-contracture positioning should be considered for 
conservatively managed wounds that do not heal within two weeks, as the 
risk of scarring increases. Thermoplastic is the ideal splinting material as it 
can be remoulded over time and achieve good conformality, but alternative 
materials, such as Plaster of Paris and PVC piping may also be considered 
in more resource-scarce settings. Innovative resources can also be used 
for mouth (wooden spatula) and neck splint (suction tubes wrapped with 
cotton and gauze).
-  Scar management
Compression therapy and massage should be used to minimize scarring and 
manage oedema. In the context of moderate and severe burns, compression 
therapy can reduce scar height, and alleviate some of the discomfort of 
immature scars, such as blood rush and itching. Scar massage similarly 
works to soften scars and can improve skin movement and reduce 
hypersensitivity (37).
5  Technical standards
4444
Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents
Compression can be achieved with bandaging, tubular elastic stockings and 
pressure garments. While customized compression garments may not be 
available in resource-scarce settings, compression should aim to achieve 
a pressure of 24 mmHg. Compression bandages or garments should be 
worn 23 hours a day, with regular monitoring, until scar maturation. Scar 
maturation can continue for 12–18 months and complications can arise for 
years following discharge from acute care. 
As patients with severe burns will continue to use compression and massage 
well beyond discharge, education in correct use/technique is critical in 
addition to education about on-going scar care. Encouraging participation 
during inpatient stay is important to improving chances of continuity post-
discharge. Identification and coordination with local rehabilitation providers 
and disability organizations is an important aspect of discharge planning, 
particularly in a mass burn incident. This is especially critical for paediatric 
patients who will require on-going intervention due to the impact of growth 
on scar tissue. 
4545
5.9   Chemical, biological, radiological and 
         nuclear (CBRN) considerations
BATs and BSTs are recommended to have the capability to support the initial care of 
CBRN patients in the event of a CBRN MCI. They are not expected to deliver care to 
patients in hot zones, nor involve themselves in scene decontamination but should 
have provision to provide an early basic package of care to include basic airway 
management, analgesia, oral rehydration, urinary catheterization, dressings and 
antibiotics as required (and potentially in the form of patient self-administered kits). 
Mental health and bereavement support is also suggested. Team members should 
have good awareness and basic training in CBRN but do not require specialist or 
higher-level training. Specific knowledge on chemical burns, thermonuclear and 
radiation burns is recommended when possible.
The general principles of burn care offered by BATs and BSTs can be applied to

Clinical recommendations: 
fluid management
6
Unlike trauma injuries resulting in massive haemorrhage and where early “fluid” 
(often packed red cells and clotting agents in addition to or instead of crystalloids) 
is required to preserve life, the fluid shifts resulting from burn injuries is slower, 
thus giving time for extended fluid management. IV fluids are routinely used in the 
management of the systemic inflammatory response and capillary leak syndrome 
following a severe burn injury, with complications such as haemoglobinuria and 
myoglobinuria from renal failure secondary to burn injuries being avoidable with 
early administration of fluids (41). However, broad evidence also exists detailing the 
complications of excessive fluid administration in patients with burn injuries (42). 
Reported complications include abdominal compartment syndrome, pulmonary 
oedema, interstitial tissue leakage, airway compromise, and acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, among others (43–45). Excessive fluid resuscitation in the first 
24 hours after a burn can occur and increases the chances of developing many of the 
complications listed above (42, 43).
Complications such as those listed above affecting just one individual will impact the 
resource and skill requirement for the patient’s on-going management – a scenario 
amplified significantly in a mass casualty situation where multiple burns patients are 
at risk of developing resource intense complications if inappropriate fluid regimes 
are used.
What triggered these recommendations?
These recommendations on fluid management of patients in mass burn incidents 
were triggered by the 2020–2023 TWG on Burns. While initial draft recommendations 
were developed from 2017–2019, the 2020–2023 group sought to review them as part 
of an external review. During those discussions, it became evident that:
-   new experiences from mass burn incidents between 2019–2023 around the 
world had formulated new opinions about fluid management in these 
contexts;
-  new evidence was available regarding fluid management in low-resource 
contexts; and
-  the previous recommendations did not follow WHO normative procedures, 
including GRADE methodology for clinical recommendations and other 
procedures outlined in the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development.

Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents
Values and preferences
Given the high volume of patients and constrained resources during MCIs, the GDG 
panel placed a relatively high priority on interventions that are feasibly and rapidly 
implemented across a large number of acutely ill patients by often inexperienced 
burn care providers, and a lower value on interventions that have high degrees of 
uncertainty with respect to clinical benefit and are unlikely to be feasible. The GDG 
acknowledged that substantial variability in these values and preferences across 
patients are likely to exist, and that frequently reassessing the available resources 
will be important.
Selecting and rating the importance of outcomes
GDG members selected and then prioritized outcomes from the perspective of 
patients via an online survey, as per Table 11 below.

6.1   Oral versus IV fluids
Practical information
Oral fluid can be provided as potable drinking water with ORS. This approach to 
patient fluid management should be continued beyond arrival at the first receiving 
hospital and guided by the patient's clinical response. If IV fluids are indicated, oral 
supplementation can continue.
Consideration should be given to oral fluid intake for patients requiring surgical 
interventions, thus requiring sedation and/or anaesthesia. It is recommended that 
if fasting is required prior to a planned surgical intervention then oral fluids may 
be temporarily halted. If an emergency procedure is required then, as per standard 
guidance, airway precautions are important. 
For patients in mass burn incidents, treat with oral fluid resuscitation, and 
where possible, supplement with IV fluid depending on patient need, clinical 
resources and provider discretion. (Conditional recommendation, very low 
certainty evidence)

Evidence to decision
Benefits and harms
IV fluid resuscitation is the standard of care when there are available clinical resources, 
and should be considered as the preferred option for patients. There are possible 
harms of oral fluid resuscitation in mass burn incidents, such as the possible risk of 
aspiration and under-resuscitation. There was no human data to inform the GDG on 
further harms, and the benefits mostly relate to the feasibility of implementation in 
mass burn incidents. 
Certainty of the evidence
There is very low certainty that oral fluid resuscitation may increase in-hospital 
mortality compared to IV fluid resuscitation, but the available evidence is uncertain. 
The effects on other outcomes are only available for acute kidney injury, where the 
effect of oral fluid resuscitation is not estimable. There is moderate certainty evidence 
that oral fluid resuscitation results in slight to no reduction in urine output during the 
first 24 hours post-injury. Data was not available for any other outcomes. 
Values and preferences
The GDG, deriving from their expertise and experience as providers in MCIs and/or in the 
care of patients with burns, placed higher priority on interventions that could be feasibly 
and rapidly delivered to a large number of acutely ill patients, often by inexperienced burn 
care providers, and made a conditional recommendation for oral fluid resuscitation in specific 
circumstances. The panel acknowledged that the context may rapidly change, whereby 
providers and resources may alter, leading to transitioning to IV fluid resuscitation at the 
earliest possible opportunity. 
Resources and other considerations
The GDG emphasized the principle of equity, where it is ensured that all patients involved 
in the mass burn incident have access to the best possible outcome. Additionally, the GDG 
emphasized adequate resources must be available for adequate monitoring such as urine 
output monitoring of individual patients who may require further management options. 
Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents

5151
Additional considerations noted by the TWG
-   There are likely to be multiple, competing demands for first responders’ time 
on scene of an MCI.
-   Logistically, the volume and weight of IV fluid that would need to be 
transported by first responders or brought on-scene if IV fluids were 
instigated during this phase may be impractical. Oral/enteral fluid 
resuscitation may provide comparative logistical advantages, such as lower 
weight and volume of ORS sachets, less equipment and less expertise for 
administration, but there are still some practicalities to be considered: 
potable water and ORS sachets need to be sourced, delivered and 
constituted, and some expertise is still required to monitor clinical response 
and tolerance.
-   The accuracy of administration of IV fluid may easily be overlooked (for 
example, ensuring an appropriate volume of fluid is titrated) and the 
attention to detail lacking. The risk of administering an inappropriate 
volume of IV fluid to a patient is thus high and the resultant fluid-related 
complications increased. This would be particularly hazardous in the pre-
hospital environment within this context to all patients but particularly those 
sustaining inhalational injuries. 
-   If extended delays in transporting the patient from the scene to a health 
facility are likely, fluids may be considered, including judicious IV fluids using 
the formulae suggested. The risks of fluid overload and other complications 
from over resuscitation by IV fluid must be considered and mitigated for, 
particularly with a wide range of provider skills in responding to mass burn 
incidents.
-   In patients with concurrent trauma injuries, on-scene IV fluids should be 
considered on a case-by-case basis as per standard trauma protocols 
according to type of injury, injury severity and the clinical status of the 
patient.

Subgroup analysis
There is insufficient data to inform on potential subgroup effects. Specific subgroups that the 
GDG were interested in were children and severity of burn, as measured by %TBSA affected. 
Clinical discretion was emphasized by the GDG, as described in the recommendation, where 
children who would not be able to follow instructions for oral resuscitation and those with a 
high severity of burn would more likely benefit from IV fluid resuscitation during mass burn 
incidents. Additionally, those severely injured with compromised mental status are at a high 
risk from complications with oral fluid resuscitation.
Clinical question/PICO
Population:     patients with major burns (≥ 15 % TBSA for adults, ≥ 10 % TBSA for 
children)
Intervention:  initial (first 24–72 hours post-burn injury) fluid resuscitation via the oral 
route
Comparator:   initial fluid resuscitation via the IV route.
Summary of findings
The summary of findings from human studies on the effect of oral/enteral fluid resuscitation 
compared to IV fluid resuscitation is presented in Table 12. Based on three randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) totalling 100 participants, oral/enteral fluid resuscitation is associated 
with a statistically insignificant increased risk of mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain, 
and little to no difference in urine output at 24 hours, with moderate certainty of evidence.

2. Indirectness: serious. Findings from clinical trial setting of individual burn care may not be directly applicable to setting of mass casualty incidents, which likely have (1) less clinical 
attention per patient, (2) greater proportion of delayed presentations or interventions, and (3) include patients with multiple injuries, inhalational injuries and comorbidities, who were 
excluded for some of these trials.
3. Imprecision: serious. Few total events. Result with wide confidence interval which includes both no effect and large effect.

6.2   Oral fluids versus no fluid
Evidence to decision
Benefits and harms
Providing fluid, of any sort, to patients with burns, was deemed by the GDG to likely 
have greater benefits over potential harms in mass burn incidents based on indirect 
evidence from the burns literature that has established the importance of fluid 
resuscitation in major burns in general, the accepted standards of care for burns under 
routine (meaning non-mass casualty) circumstances, and scientific understanding of 
the pathophysiology of burn injuries and burn shock. 
Certainty of the evidence
There is no published human evidence to inform this recommendation. The GDG 
examined animal evidence, which was downrated substantially for indirectness. 
Values and preferences
The GDG, deriving from their expertise and experience as providers in MCIs and/or 
in the care of patients with burns, placed higher priority on interventions that could 
be feasibly and rapidly delivered to a large number of acutely ill patients, often by 
inexperienced burn care providers, and stated that providing oral fluid, compared to 
no fluid, would be preferred. 
Resources and other considerations
The GDG emphasizes the principle of equity, where it is ensured that all patients 
involved in the mass burn incident have access to the best possible outcome. Oral 
fluid was deemed to be widely available, even in the most austere of circumstances. 
For patients in mass burn incidents, treat with oral fluid compared to no fluid 
(Best practice statement).

6.3   Timing of fluids
Evidence to decision
Benefits and harms
Early initiation of fluids for patients with burns was deemed by the GDG to likely 
have greater benefits over potential harms in mass burn incidents based on indirect 
evidence from the burns literature on timeliness of fluid resuscitation in major burns 
in general, the accepted standards of care for burns under routine (meaning non-
mass casualty) circumstances, and scientific understanding of the pathophysiology of 
burn injuries and evolution of burn shock. 
The only harm mentioned related to feasibility of implementation, where on-scene 
implementation was deemed potentially challenging. Further work to ensure that 
oral fluid is available in sufficient quantities by first responders would be beneficial.
Certainty of the evidence
There is very low-certainty evidence that delayed (at health facility) initiation of IV 
fluid resuscitation may increase the occurrence of acute kidney injury following major 
burn injury, based on one observational study. There was no evidence to inform the 
GDG on other clinical outcomes of relevance. Given this, a best practice statement was 
issued based on the overall importance of this guidance to health practice, indirect 
evidence of benefits over harms, and low likelihood of direct evidence to emerge.
For patients in mass burn incidents, give fluids as early as possible, on-scene 
or at health facility (Best practice statement).

The GDG, deriving from their expertise and experience as providers in MCIs and/or 
in the care of patients with burns, placed higher priority on interventions that could 
be feasibly and rapidly delivered to large number of acutely ill patients, often by 
inexperienced burn care providers, and stated that providing early fluid, compared to 
later fluid, was consistent with these values. 
Resources and other considerations
Providing early fluid, compared to later fluid, can be considered in the context of 
recommendations for oral fluid, when compared with IV fluid. This approach 
incorporates provider discretion, patient needs and clinical resources available.
Decision-making between oral fluid and IV fluid, supplemented with decision-making 
between early fluid versus later fluid, will necessarily be driven by the context that 
the care providers are facing.
The GDG emphasizes principles of equity, where the aim is that all patients involved 
in the mass burn incident have access to the best possible outcome. This approach, 
where early fluid is recommended, compared with later fluid, is consistent with this 
focus on seeking equity in clinical outcomes.

Summary of findings
The summary of findings for delayed (at health facility) initiation of IV fluids compared

Explanations
1. Risk of bias: serious. Some concerns due to lack of clarity on the measure and time frame for outcome of acute kidney injury used in this study. Baseline comparison of 
intervention and exposure groups unavailable, therefore unclear as to whether there were any differences and biases within these groups. Included numbers in each group 
were only a sub-set of total study participants.
2. Indirectness: serious. Findings based on individual care in battlefield/combat casualty care setting. While there may be similarities to MCI in terms of resource constraints, 
there are also key differences such as high level of attention due to individual cases, less delay to presentation, and higher access to resources on arrival at military hospital. 
3. Imprecision: serious. Single study with small sample size.

6.4   Formulae for calculation of fluid resuscitation 
         requirements
Practical information
There are several standard formulae for calculation of fluid resuscitation requirements 
in burns patients. Due to lack of evidence, the panel could not make a recommendation 
regarding use of one formula versus another. The formula utilized by health workers 
in an MCI should ideally be what is most familiar. An example calculation is described 
in Table 15.
For patients in mass burn incidents, use standard formulae for calculation of 
fluid resuscitation requirements (Best practice statement).

Evidence to decision
Benefits and harms
The benefits of a modified or simplified formula are through the ease of implementation 
across a large number of patients, where a calculation of, for example, 100 mL/kg/hr 
for the first 24 hours would be implemented for every arriving patient with > 40 % TBSA 
burn. The harms of implementing a simplified formula are a failure to incorporate the 
diversity of patients and their severity of burn injury, along with a lack of familiarity of 
the formula for health workers already under duress from a MCI, with the possibility 
of over- or under-resuscitating patients. This is potentially most challenging in small 
children, where the simplified non-%TBSA-based formula provides much less fluid in 
the first 8 hours of the resuscitation period across most range of %TBSA burn sizes 
than do standard %TBSA-based formulae. 
Certainty of the evidence
There were no studies that met the search criteria comparing outcomes from using 
simplified (non-%TBSA dependent) formulae versus standard (%TBSA-dependent) 
formulae for calculating fluid resuscitation requirements. Modelling studies were 
found, but these were not deemed sufficient by the GDG. Given the importance to 
health practice of actionable recommendation on this matter, and that comparative 
evidence was unlikely to emerge, a best practice statement on using standard 
formulae was issued.

Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents
Values and preferences
The GDG emphasized providing each patient the best opportunity to achieve the best 
possible outcome. Concerns regarding inappropriate resuscitation strategies with a 
simplified formula, in the absence of any comparative evidence suggesting benefit, 
coupled with ease of calculation, generally of %TBSA-based formulae, led the GDG to 
consider that the current standard of care that is used in non-mass casualty situations 
be considered for mass burn incidents. 
Resources and other considerations
Standard formulae for fluid resuscitation requirements reflect %TBSA involvement. 
This is often difficult to assess precisely, and the GDG emphasized that while a 
simplified fluid resuscitation formula to ease feasibility of implementation might be 
useful, the risks of over-simplifying resuscitation strategies could not be justified due 
to the absence of evidence.
Further research on the safety of simplified (non-%TBSA dependent) formulae for 
fluid resuscitation requirements are required.

Practical information
The use of standard formulae to calculate fluid resuscitation requirements is best 
practice, as recommended in the preceding section. When using these formulae, 
there is established practice of calculating fluid resuscitation requirements from time 
of injury. However, in the context of mass burn incidents, no recommendation could 
be made on the optimal timing to be used. 
Evidence to decision
Benefits and harms
In MCIs the time of injury may be either unknown or specifically known, assuming 
common time of injury across patients. As in all situations, there may be delays 
in receiving medical attention and thus delays in initiating fluid resuscitation. The 
benefits of calculating from the time of injury is the avoidance of a possibility of under-
resuscitation by providing catch-up fluids. The harms of calculating from the time of 
injury include the feasibility of knowing the relevant information or the possibility of 
having the wrong information as well as potential for large-volume catch-up fluids 
when there are significant delays to initiation, leading to either fluid over- or under-
resuscitation.
The confidence in the effect estimates was so low, especially with no comparative 
evidence, that the GDG felt any recommendation on this would be too speculative. 
Given this lack of evidence, the lack of knowledge relating to downstream effects of 
relevant comparators, and the criteria for issuing a best practice statement not being 
fulfilled, it was elected to issue no recommendation.
For patients in mass burn incidents, there is no recommendation on the optimal 
timing in calculation of fluid resuscitation requirements (No recommendation).

Standards and recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents
Certainty of the evidence
There is no evidence to inform the GDG on clinical outcomes of relevance, with one 
observational study available that was not informative on the relevant outcomes. 
Values and preferences
Incorporating the values and preferences helped inform the GDG to come to a “No 
recommendation”. Acknowledging the evidence base, established clinical practice, 
and values and preferences led to highly speculative recommendations, which the 
GDG felt it better left as “No recommendation”.
Resources and other considerations
Clinical teams can consider the local context when considering implementing varied 
approaches to catch-up fluid resuscitation strategies. As discussed in previous 
recommendations, fluids should be initiated as early as possible, hopefully obviating the 
need for this recommendation and limiting the relevance of catch-up fluid resuscitation 
strategies. However, mass burn incidents vary greatly, and standardizing fluid 
resuscitation protocols across a group of patients who arrive simultaneously will assist 
with implementation. Regardless of timing for calculation, fluid status of the patient 
should be regularly assessed and adjusted using standard measures of urine output, 
capillary refill time, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and other parameters.
Clinical question/PICO
Population:    patients with major burns (≥ 15 % TBSA for adults and ≥ 10 % TBSA 
for children) in resource-limited settings, defined as: (i) low- or 
middle-income countries, (ii) battlefield/far-forward combat 
casualty settings, or (iii) austere or wilderness environments.
Intervention: fluid requirements calculated from time of arrival
Comparator:   fluid requirements calculated from time of injury
Summary of findings
The available evidence on calculating fluid requirements from time of arrival (see 
Table 16) at the first receiving health facility compared to from time of injury is 
extremely limited and very uncertain. Based on a sole, single-armed intervention 
study, calculating from time of arrival maintained adequate urine output and had no 
complications of fluid over- or under-resuscitation. The intervention effect remains 
unknown as there was no comparison group.

summary
* The risk in the intervention group (and its 95 % confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95 % CI).
CI: confidence interval
Single-arm observational cohort study with 10 participants. Occurrence of acute kidney injury 0/10 (0 %), adequate urine output 10/10 (100 %), and complications of fluid over-
resuscitation 0/10 (0 %).
Explanations
1. Risk of bias: serious. Some concerns due to lack of identification of potential confounders as well as lack of clarity on measurement and time frames for outcomes of acute 
kidney injury and fluid over-resuscitation.
2. Indirectness: serious. Paediatric population, and in context of individual care, which may differ from expected level of care during a mass casualty incident.
3. Imprecision: serious. Single study with small sample size. Optimal information size not met.

Research needs7
The following areas for further research on mass burn incidents were highlighted by 
the TWG:
-  burn injury triage for mass burn incidents; 
-  studies evaluating efficacy and outcomes of using non-%TBSA dependent 
formulae for fluid calculation;
-  efficacy and availability of impregnated dressings (such as silver) and 
anti-septic agents (such as povidone-iodine, alcohol, chlorhexidine, and 
honey) in lower- middle-income countries and mass burn incidents; and
-  open wound management during mass burn incidents, including 
frequency of showering, application of topical agents, and splinting/
rehabilitation manoeuvres.

Annex 8
Annex 8. Clinical recommendations development process and methods
This annex provides further details on the process and methods used in the 
development of the clinical recommendations in Chapter 6. This followed the process 
and methods outlined in the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development, 2 nd edition, 
with oversight of the WHO Guideline Review Committee.
Evidence synthesis and assessment
The priority questions to be addressed by the clinical recommendations were 
identified by the GDG. These were formulated into PICO-structured review questions 
by the systematic review team with input from the methodologist, clinical chair, 
GDG and technical members of the WHO Steering Group. The important outcomes of 
interest were rated and selected by the GDG. The systematic reviews were conducted 
in accordance with pre-defined protocols and the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The available evidence 
was synthesized with outcome-based intervention effect estimates, where amenable, 
and evidence certainty assessed using GRADE methodology. These were presented 
to the GDG using GRADE summary of findings tables.
Formulation of recommendations
The GRADE approach was used to formulate recommendations. GDG deliberations on 
the direction and strength of recommendations were facilitated by the methodologist 
and clinical chair. In their formulation, the GDG considered the balance of benefits 
and harms (with reference to the GRADE summary of findings tables, including effect 
estimates and confidence intervals), certainty of evidence, values and preferences, 
resource implications, and other considerations such as equity, acceptability, 
and feasibility. As recognized in the limitations of the GRADE approach, there 
were circumstances in which the GDG was unable to issue a GRADE-formulated 
recommendation, particularly due to lack of direct evidence, but for which actionable 
statements were deemed necessary for health practice and where there were certainty 
of benefits outweighing undesirable effects supported by indirect evidence. In such 
circumstances, an ungraded Best Practice Statement was issued in accordance 
with the five criteria set out by the GRADE Working Group (48). Decisions and 
recommendations were made by consensus. Pre-defined rules for decision-making 
had specified a voting process in case consensus could not be reached: 80 % of GDG 
members was required to formulate a strong recommendation, and a simple majority 
for conditional recommendations. However, in the end, voting was not needed for 
any of the recommendations. The final recommendation statements were drafted by 
the responsible technical officer according to the GDG’s decisions and formulations, 
approved by the GDG, and shared with the WHO Steering Group.

External review
The clinical recommendations (and full document) were reviewed by an external 
review group composed of members of the EMT Strategic Advisory Group, with 
balanced representation of geographical regions and gender. Any feedback and 
comments were considered by the GDG, and incorporated as appropriate by the 
responsible technical officer. The clinical recommendations section (Chapter 6) of 
the final document was then reviewed and approved by the WHO Guideline Review 
Committee.

Annexes
Management of conflicts of interest
All contributors were required to complete and return the standard WHO Declaration 
of Interests forms for experts along with their CVs. These were evaluated by the 
responsible technical officer for relevance of any declared interests, and for 
significance of any potential conflicts of interest based on their nature, number and 
value, scope of relationship, and extent of discretion. The approach to managing 
any significant conflicts of interest was partial or total exclusion from participation, 
assessed and/or consulted on a case-by-case basis. The contributing experts’ names 
and their brief biographies were compiled and made publicly available.

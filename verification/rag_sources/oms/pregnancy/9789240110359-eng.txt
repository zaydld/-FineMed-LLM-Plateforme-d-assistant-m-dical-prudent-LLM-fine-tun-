Glossary
Note: Terms in definitions also defined in this glossary shown in italics.
Business process A set of related activities or tasks performed together to 
achieve the objectives of the health programme area, such as 
registration, counselling, referral (1,2).
Data dictionary A centralized repository of information about the data 
elements that contains their definition, relationships, origin, 
usage and type of data. For this digital adaptation kit, the data 
dictionary is provided as a spreadsheet.
Data element A unit of data that has specific and precise meaning.
Decision-support logic A set of decision rules for standard and exceptional cases that 
is separate from the business process. This helps reduce the 
complexity of the business process depiction without losing 
the detail necessary for coding the rules required for system 
functionality. 
Decision support (for 
health workers)
Digitized job aids that combine an individual’s health 
information with the health worker’s knowledge and clinical 
protocols to assist health workers in making diagnosis and 
treatment decisions (3,4).
Decision-support table Semi-structured way to depict each discrete decision that 
will need to be embedded in the system. Depending on the 
complexity of the clinical guidelines, there will likely be 
multiple decision-support tables.
Digital health The systematic application of information and 
communications technologies, computer science and data to 
support informed decision-making by individuals, the health 
workforce and health systems, to strengthen resilience to 
disease and improve health and wellness (1,5).
Functional requirement A capability the system must have in order to meet the end 
users’ needs and achieve tasks within the business process. 
Health information 
system
A system that integrates data collection, processing, 
reporting and use of the information necessary for improving 
health service effectiveness and efficiency through better 
management at all levels of health services (6).
Health management 
information system 
(HMIS)
An information system specifically designed to assist in 
the management and planning of health programmes, as 
opposed to delivery of care (6).
Interoperability The ability of different applications to access, exchange, 
integrate and use data in a coordinated manner through the 
use of shared application interfaces and standards, within 
and across organizational, regional and national boundaries, 
to provide timely and seamless portability of information and 
optimize health outcomes.
Non-functional 
requirement
General attribute or feature of the digital system to ensure 
usability and overcome technical and physical constraints. 
Examples of non-functional requirements include ability 
to work offline, multiple language settings and password 
protection.
Persona A generic aggregate description of a person involved in or 
benefitting from a health programme.

Digital adaptation kit for self-monitoring of blood pressure during pregnancy
Background
As digital technologies are increasingly being leveraged to enable and support health-service delivery and accountability, health ministries and partners have 
recognized the value of digital health as articulated within the World Health Assembly resolution (1) and the WHO Global strategy on digital health 2020–2025 (2). 
Similarly, funding agencies have advocated for the rational use of digital tools as part of efforts to expand coverage and quality of services, as well as promote data 
use and monitoring efforts (3–5).
However, guidelines are often only available in a narrative format that requires a resource-intensive process to be elaborated into the specifications that are 
needed for operationalizing into digital systems. This translation of guidelines for digital systems often results in subjective interpretation for implementers and 
software vendors, which can lead to inconsistencies or inability to verify the content within these systems, potentially leading to adverse health outcomes and other 
unintended effects (6–9). Despite the abundance of digital tools developed and deployed for health care, there is often limited transparency in the data model, 
logic model, and the evidence-based clinical or public health recommendations contained in these digital tools, as system documentation may be unavailable or 
proprietary, requiring governments to start from scratch and expend additional resources each time they intend to update and deploy such a system. This lack of 
documentation undermines the credibility of such systems, leading to dependency on one vendor and haphazard deployments that are unscalable, impeding the 
opportunity for interoperability that would otherwise enable continuity of care (9–11).
WHO standards-based, machine-readable, adaptive, requirements-based and testable (SMART) guidelines provide essential ingredients to facilitate digital health 
transformation of health programmes in a way that is consistent with recommended clinical, public health data practices and interoperability standards. To ensure 
countries can effectively benefit from digital health investments, digital adaptation kits (DAKs), which are the second, operational guidelines layer of the SMART 
guidelines approach, are designed to facilitate the accurate reflection of WHO clinical, public health and data use guidelines within the digital systems that countries 
are adopting. DAKs are operational, software-neutral, standardized documentation that distil clinical, public health and data use guidance into a format that can 
be transparently incorporated into digital systems (11). Although digital implementations comprise multiple factors – including the (i) health domain data and 
content, (ii) digital intervention or functionality and (iii) digital application or communication channel for delivering the digital intervention – DAKs focus primarily 
on ensuring the validity of the health content (Fig. 1)  (12, 13). Accordingly, DAKs provide the generic content requirements that should be housed within digital 
systems, independent of a specific software application and with the intention that countries can customize them to local needs.
For this DAK, the requirements are based on systems that provide the functionalities of personal health tracking (see Box 1) and include components such as 
personas, workflows, core data elements and decision-support algorithms. Operational outputs, such as spreadsheets of the data dictionary and the detailed 
decision-support algorithms, are included as part of the DAK as practical resources that implementers can use as starting points when developing digital systems. 
Furthermore, data components within the DAK are mapped to standards-based classifications and terminologies, such as the International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD), Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC), International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI), International Classification of 
Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) to facilitate interoperability.

Overview
Description of personal health tracking
Box 1
Personal health tracking
The use of mobile applications, phone-based sensors, health records, and wearables for individuals to monitor their own health 
status. This can include examples of wearable sensors, web-tools and apps that allow individuals to review and track their 
clinical and general health status.
1.4.1  
Access by the 
individual to their own 
medical or summary 
health records
- Self-access to health record by an individual; patient’s 
own access to their health record.
- Ability for persons to track their health history and 
clinical record.
Electronic personal health record : “makes it possible for 
patients to augment their medical records with health status 
data that they have gathered on their own”.
1.4.2  
Self-monitoring of 
health or diagnostic 
data by the individual
-  Personal health monitoring, self-tracking self-care, self-
monitoring.
- Sensors and wearables for personal health monitoring.
- Person’s health data are collected based on a device a 
person uses on their own.
Wearables and fitness trackers : Applications that can track 
every part of your day—including activity, exercise, food, weight 
and sleep.
1.4.3  
Active data capture/
documentation by the 
individual
-  Personal health monitoring, self-tracking self-care, self-
monitoring, journaling (capture of patient-originated 
data), documentation of health status and activities by 
individual(s).
Period-tracking application : The individual “enters the date 
of her last period and the service informs her of her fertile 
days during the cycle. She receives alerts on her ‘unsafe days’ 
throughout the month.” 
1.4.4  
Access by the 
individual to verifiable 
documentation of a 
health event or health 
status
-	 Confirmation/verification	of	an	individual’s	status	for	
various public and private transactions including for 
insurance status, vaccination record, disability record, 
social protection.
-		Access	to	documentation	of 	health	status	via	a	verifiable	
certificate.
Applications that provide individuals with access to verifiable 
credentials that confirm their health status including the 
occurrence of a health event.

Digital adaptation kit for self-monitoring of blood pressure during pregnancy
The DAKs follow a modular approach in detailing the 
data and content requirements for a specific health 
programme area – such as antenatal care, family 
planning, HIV/AIDs, tuberculosis – among the different 
health areas for which DAKs have been developed. 
Figure 1 outlines DAKs and their implementation in 
digital health care. This DAK focuses on providing the 
content requirements for self-monitoring of blood 
pressure (SMBP) in pregnancy through use and 
tracking of digital personal health records. Personal 
health record is defined as a “record of an individual’s 
health information in a structured digital format for a set 
of defined use cases over which the person has agency. ”

Digital adaptation kits within a strategic vision for SMART guidelines
The operational and standardized documentation reflected within the DAKs represents one of the steps within a broader vision of SMART guidelines. SMART 
guidelines aim to maximize health impact through improved fidelity and uptake of recommendations within standards-based digital systems via a systematic 
process of transforming guideline development, delivery and application (8, 15). DAKs serve as a prerequisite for developing computable or machine-readable 
guidelines, as well as executable reference software and advanced analytics for precision health. Figure 2 provides an overview of the different layers of the SMART 
guidelines continuum and where DAKs fit within this strategy (8, 15, 16).

Digital self-care interventions
1  Throughout this DAK, “clients” refers to both self-carers and caregivers such as a parent caring for a child. See the definition for client in Part 2: Component 2: Generic personas of this DAK for a more detailed definition.
Self-care interventions enable individuals, families and 
communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain 
health, and cope with illness and disability with or without 
the support of a health worker (17). Self-care interventions 
are relevant for all health areas and can be categorized into 
various modalities such as self-testing or self-management 
(see Fig. 3) (17, 18). 
Digital technologies and platforms support clients1 in 
achieving tasks essential for access, use and uptake of 
self-care interventions. This includes accessing health 
information, learning how to use a health-care product 
or intervention, managing personal health data, and 
making informed health decisions on evidence-based 
drugs and therapeutics, medical devices and diagnostics, 
information and products (17). Digital health interventions 
(DHIs) within these tools can make the accomplishment 
of such tasks easier and more effective. These DHIs are 
not only for software applications and services at the 
client level, but also for software used by health and care 
workers – key players in the digital self-care intervention 
ecosystem. Whether the user is using a client-facing system 
or a provider-facing system, a digital tool (delivering one 
or more DHIs) supports the user’s capability in achieving 
different tasks essential for the successful use of the self-
care intervention (19).

Overview
Objectives of this digital adaptation kit
This DAK focuses on SMBP in pregnancy and aims to provide a common language across various audiences – health programme managers, software developers, 
and implementers of digital systems – to ensure a common understanding of the appropriate health information content requirements within a defined health 
programme area, as a mechanism to catalyse the effective use of these digital systems. This DAK also complements the health worker-facing Digital adaptation 
kit for antenatal care: operational requirements for implementing WHO recommendations in digital systems (ANC DAK) (20), in which self-care interventions such as 
SMBP may be integrated.
The key objectives of this DAK are:
 » to foster a common understanding of the particular content needs of the digital self-care intervention ecosystem among health programme leads and digital 
health teams (including software developers);
 » to ensure adherence to WHO clinical, public health and device use guidelines to facilitate consistency of the health content used in the specific aspects of 
provider-facing and client-facing digital systems that support self-monitoring interventions; and
 » to provide a starting point for the specifications for self-care interventions that may be executed through a digital home-based record, describing some of the 
core data elements and decision-support logic that should be included in this type of tool with the expectation that additional content will be added on in a 
modular fashion.
Specifically, the DAK details the digital requirements to implement the following recommendations:
WHO recommends self-care interventions within a safe, supportive and enabling environment with appropriate links to the health system (21). This first 
edition of the DAK on self-care interventions focuses on self-monitoring blood pressure in pregnancy in which WHO suggests making the self-monitoring 
of blood pressure during pregnancy available as an additional option to clinic blood pressure monitoring by health workers solely during antenatal 
contacts, for individuals with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (17).
DAKs have also been developed for antenatal care (ANC), family planning, tuberculosis, child health in humanitarian settings, immunizations and HIV. This approach 
is being expanded to additional health domains, such as postnatal care and community health. All these DAKs work towards a comprehensive approach for 
standardized software requirements for primary health-care settings.

Overview
How this digital adaptation kit was developed
Existing WHO guidelines, guidance and tools considered relevant for the development of a DAK dedicated to SMBP in pregnancy were mapped. Key resources 
included the WHO guideline on self-care interventions for health and well-being, 2022 revision (17) and additional relevant guidance documents focused on the 
management of blood pressure and complications in pregnancy (see the WHO guidelines, recommendations and guidance section in this chapter). Relevant 
recommendations from this guideline were extracted to inform the basis for the DAK. This process also informed the development of the workflows, data dictionary 
and decision-support logic algorithms. These components were further refined with external reviewers and WHO staff. A specialist in hypertensive disorders of 
pregnancies reviewed the technical content for further validation. Other published DAKs, including the teams responsible for their development, were consulted as 
needed to ensure alignment across across the SMART guidelines programme.
All individual external contributors involved in the development and review of this DAK declared any potential conflicts of interest prior to providing their 
contributions, including contributions made during their participation in any technical consultations. These declarations were reviewed by WHO, which found none 
of the contributors to have conflicting interests that would influence the content of this publication.
How to use this digital adaptation kit
Once the strategic vision for point-of-service systems has been developed, SMART guidelines can assist in determining the necessary health content requirements 
based on available guidance. In contexts where an overarching vision may not exist, users should first consult the WHO–International Telecommunication 
Union National eHealth strategy toolkit (25), WHO guideline: recommendations on digital interventions for health system strengthening (13), and WHO’s Digital 
implementation investment guide (DIIG) (12) to establish a better understanding of how to select and apply appropriate DHIs. Figure 4 situates DAKs within the 
broader set of resources for planning and implementing digital health systems.

Overview
Target audience
The primary target audience for this DAK are software developers and health programme managers within the health ministries, who will be working with their 
digital or health information systems counterparts in determining the health content requirements for SMBP in pregnancy. The DAK also equips individuals 
responsible for translating health-system processes and guidance documents for use within digital systems with the necessary components to kick-start the process 
of developing personal health tracking systems in a standards-compliant manner. These individuals are also known as business analysts who interface between 
health content experts and software development teams. 
Additionally, using this DAK requires a collaboration between health programme managers responsible for maternal health and counterparts in digital health and 
health information systems. Although each DAK focuses on a particular health programme area (in this case, SMBP in pregnancy), the DAKs are envisioned to be 
used in a modular format and link to other health programme areas within primary health-care settings to support integration across services.
Scenarios for using the DAK
The DAK may be used across various scenarios, some of which are listed below.
Scenario 1
Incorporating WHO guideline 
content into existing personal 
health tracking systems
Implementers that may already have developed personal health tracking systems may use the information in the DAK to cross-
check whether the underlying content and data for specific health programme areas are aligned with WHO guidelines. Users of the 
DAK can identify and extract specific decision algorithms that would need to be incorporated into their existing digital systems. 
By reviewing this systematic documentation, implementers can more readily identify differences in workflows, data inputs and 
decision-support logics to examine the rationale for deviations and understanding local adaptions of guideline content.
Scenario 2
Transitioning from paper to 
digital
Some implementers may currently have paper-based approaches for personal health tracking that they would like to digitize. Users 
in this scenario may review the DAK as a starting point for streamlining the necessary data elements and decision support that 
should be in the optimized client-level digital system. Users may also then refer to the paper-based tools to determine whether 
there are missing fields or content that should also be included within the digital system.
Scenario 3
Leveraging data standards to 
promote interoperability and 
integrated systems
This DAK includes data elements mapped to ICD 11th Revision (ICD-11) codes, ICD 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes, LOINC, ICHI, ICF 
and SNOMED codes to support the design of interoperable systems. The data dictionary provides the necessary codes for different 
data elements, thus reducing the time for implementers to incorporate these global standards into the design of their digital 
systems. Box 3 provides guidance on developing the third layer of the SMART guidelines and its role in designing interoperable 
systems, such as linking to point-of-service systems (e.g. an electronic health record) managed by a health worker.
OVERVIEW
14
Digital adaptation kit for self-monitoring of blood pressure during pregnancy
Scenario 4
Establishing benchmark 
requirements to facilitate 
governance of digital health 
systems
The DAK allows for countries to clearly outline software-agnostic baseline expectations and requirements for a digital service and 
application for a particular use case. The templated format allows for countries to establish their own standards for any digital 
service and application that is to be implemented within the country. The DAK provides a shared language to allow for alignment 
across all the relevant stakeholders, regardless of which software system is used.
Box 3
Third knowledge layer (L3) of SMART guidelines
The next step in the digitalization journey of normative content involves the 
development and/or implementation of the computable and machine-readable 
content of standards-based, machine-readable, adaptive, requirements-based 
and testable (SMART) guidelines, also known as the third knowledge layer (L3). 
This layer builds on L2 and is represented as a Fast Healthcare Interoperability 
Resources (FHIR) implementation guide. It focuses on producing machine-
readable recommendations that can be tested for conformance to interoperability 
standards. This step ensures that the semi-structured normative content, in the 
form of the digital adaptation kit (DAK), is converted to a machine-readable format 
that promotes interoperability and can be easily adapted to meet the requirements 
of different contexts. Developing an L3 provides benefits to multiple stakeholders. 
Some, but not all, are listed below:
 » Ministry of health: the localized implementation guide will promote a local 
ecosystem of standards that many software vendors can tap into, thereby 
avoiding software lock-in;
 » Technology partners: with standards-based machine-readable code available 
within the implementation guide, partners have a quicker development cycle 
and easier adoption of standards-based code into solutions;
 » Health workers: greater support for day-to-day workload by having access to 
decision-support logic within digital systems.
Stakeholders looking to understand the importance of interoperability and its 
key components, and to plan investments in integrating these components in the 
national digital health systems, should consult the Stepwise toolkit for planning & 
budgeting interoperability of digital health solutions (12, 26).
Key considerations for developing L3
Before developing or implementing the L3, it is important to:
 » Scope the needs: identify the requirements of the digital tool, such as 
translation needs and test data generation needs;
 » Budget and resources: determine the necessary budget and required 
resources;
 » Team competence: assemble a team with the required software development 
skills and experience to develop and/or implement a FHIR implementation 
guide;
 » Review the L3 SOP: the L3 SOP is intended to guide developers and 
implementers through the process of creating an HL7 FHIR implementation 
guide following the WHO SMART guidelines approach. The SMART guidelines 
community is actively working on defining the SOP for authoring L3 
implementation guides and the latest version is available here (https://smart.
who.int/ig-starter-kit/).
The status of all L3 implementation guides developed by WHO and implementation 
partners can be consulted at the WHO Smart Guidelines Publications site.

guidance documents that support these interventions form the basis of the digital adaptation kit (DAK) content, reformatted for use in software development.
2  This intervention requires the proper connectivity and digital infrastructure, so its implementation timeline may differ from country to country, depending upon the maturity of the country’s digital ecosystem.
Interventions based on WHO’s UHC Compendium
This DAK module focuses on self-care interventions in the antenatal period that may benefit from the pregnant client’s use of the digital home-based or personal 
health record (HB/PHR) or similar software. Specifically, this DAK module details the software requirements for the following, as listed in the WHO UHC Compendium 
on health interventions for universal health coverage (UHC) (22):
 » blood pressure (BP) monitoring for the management of antenatal care (ANC) complications
 » electronic or telephonic transfer of home blood pressure readings using validated devices2 (where possible)
Self-monitoring of blood pressure during pregnancy
To monitor and help manage the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including early detection of pre-eclampsia, WHO suggests that a pregnant client can 
choose to measure their own BP in addition to BP measurement in a clinic setting (17). Following diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder and having been deemed 
eligible by a health worker, the client uses a BP device approved for home-based use to take BP measurements, sometimes multiple times a day, depending on the 
treatment plan. Each time the pregnant client takes a BP reading, they enter this information into the BP measurement device. In response, the personal health 
tracking application generates various actions based on the system’s comparison of the self-monitoring of blood pressure (SMBP) measurement results with 
standard BP thresholds for specific hypertensive conditions. One of these actions could be to collect contextual data on the client’s current condition, behaviour 
and environment around the time of the SMBP measurement. Another action may instruct the client to contact a health worker or go to a health facility right away 
for a consultation, in addition to continuing with regular ANC contacts. SMBP continues until birth (or after birth if needed), or when the health worker changes the 
management plan.

A persona is a depiction of a relevant stakeholder, or end user of the digital system. The specific roles and demographic profile of the personas will vary depending 
on the local setting. Where available, generic personas for the various health worker roles are based on descriptions in the International Standard Classification 
of Occupations (ISCO) (39), and on competencies and qualifications denoted in other WHO health workforce documentation. Generic personas for other roles in 
the self-care intervention ecosystem, including clients, are based on the characteristics of people who use self-care interventions (21), as well as in the published 
literature. It should be noted that all of the personas reflect a synthesis of profiles across multiple contexts. Further contextualization will be required at the local 
level according to the needs, motivations and challenges of the personas in each setting.
Targeted generic personas
A persona is a generic depiction of a relevant stakeholder, or end user of the system. The key user personas for self-care interventions will vary depending on the 
business process, as well as the self-care intervention being used. While the focus of any self-care intervention is on the client – who is a key persona in all business 
processes – health workers also play essential roles. Descriptions of key personas are given in Table 3.

Client The person acting to “promote health, prevent disease, maintain health, and cope with illness and disability with or without the 
support of a health worker” (21) by using a self-care intervention on themselves, a family member or friend to whom they voluntarily 
give care without compensation. Clients are a diverse population group, representing different demographics, backgrounds and 
social situations, with varying motivations for choosing self-care interventions. Clients may use a self-care intervention for one 
condition but choose a facility-based intervention for another. They may also choose self-care interventions because they are in 
a vulnerable population, avoiding facility-based care because of access issues or from a fear of stigma, discrimination or other 
repercussions. Clients do not typically have extensive health-care knowledge or training.

Additional considerations for contextualizing personas
Although this section provides an overview of the generic roles of the targeted personas, it will be important to contextualize these personas to your setting. The 
personas described in Tables 3 and 4 can be supplemented by reflecting on these additional considerations.
 » Background and demographics: For example, what is their age or familiarity with digital devices? Do they own a mobile phone or a smartphone?
 » Context: What is the level of internet connectivity? How are the personas compensated? How far away is the nearest referral facility? What other personas or 
health workers do they interact with?
 » Challenges: What are the day-to-day challenges the end user might face?

User scenarios are a narrative description of how the end user would interact with the digital system. The user scenario is provided to help the reader better 
understand how the system will be used and how it would fit into existing workflows. It is to provide context in a story format. Furthermore, within the user scenario, 
it should be possible to derive the key components that are further elaborated in the rest of the DAK. This includes the core data elements, decision-support logic 
and core functionality of a needed digital system. A user scenario should:
 » include personas involved based on the generic personas component;
 » have narrative descriptions of who and how a digital system would be used;
 » provide details on what kinds of data are collected and decisions are made; and
 » reflect the workflows that will be further elaborated on in Component 4: Business processes and workflows.
How to interpret user scenarios
User scenarios are helpful tools that not only improve understanding of the context in which a digital tool would operate but also generate insights into the key 
data elements that would need to be recorded and accounted for in the database. Additionally, the context in which the tool would operate, illuminated by the user 
scenarios, provides insight into some functional and non-functional requirements that the system would also need. For example, in the user scenario below, some 
key data elements that need to be recorded and/or calculated are highlighted in yellow. Highlighted in blue is the decision-support logic that can be automated in 
the system. Highlighted in green are some key functional and non-functional requirements that should be included in the system. Table 5 provides an interpretation 
of the example user scenario.

Key Personas Client: Grace
Community health worker: Irene 
Nurse/midwife: Aisha
Grace is pregnant and lives far away from her nearest health clinic. Irene, a community health worker (CHW), visits Grace regularly to check in and provide ANC support, in between her clinic contacts. 
When Grace is in her fifth month of pregnancy, Irene finds that Grace’s BP is elevated, at 148/94 mmHg. She arranges for Grace to visit the clinic right away, where Aisha, the nurse/midwife, performs 
a clinical examination (including a proteinuria test) and does not find Grace to be in any immediate danger. However, she does diagnose Grace with gestational hypertension. To prevent any further 
complications, Aisha wants to monitor Grace’s BP daily, and have Irene check on her more frequently.
As it is challenging for Grace to travel to the clinic, and because Aisha believes Grace is a good candidate for SMBP , Aisha discusses SMBP intervention with Grace. Aisha teaches Grace how to use a BP 
measurement device properly, giving her a pamphlet and a link to a training video. She also shows Grace the help options in the personal health tracking application. She asks Grace to demonstrate 
what she has learned by taking her own BP measurement in the examination room.

A business process is a set of related activities or tasks performed together to achieve the objectives of the health programme area, such as registration, counselling, 
referrals (12, 24). Workflows are a visual representation of the progression of activities (tasks, events, interactions) that are performed within the business 
process (24). The workflow provides a story for the business process being diagrammed and is used to enhance communication and collaboration among users, 
stakeholders and engineers.
This DAK focuses on key business processes conducted by the personas (described in Component 2) as part of SMBP in pregnancy. These business processes are 
described in Table 6. For each of these business processes, the corresponding business processes, data elements and decision-support needs are detailed within the 
following sections of this document.
Table 6 provides an overview of the key business processes conducted by the various personas for the self-care intervention ecosystem. For each business process, 
the table summarizes the objective, task set and triggers that motivate the persona to do these tasks.
Taken together, all of these business processes provide a comprehensive picture of a self-care client’s health journey when using an intervention that may benefit 
from a personal health tracking application. However, to keep the scope manageable and within the realm of WHO’s mission, not all business processes are fully 
operationalized. Therefore, although this DAK module describes all the business processes through workflows, annotations, and functional and non-functional 
requirements, only half of them have decision logic and data elements ready for DAK readers to adapt and deploy in their digital systems. Future iterations of this 
DAK will operationalize the business processes further.

Overview of key processes
This section illustrates the workflows of the identified processes using standardized notations for business process mapping, based on the business process model 
and notation (BPMN) standard (42). Table 7 provides an overview of this notation, while Figure 5 shows an overview of key processes for SMBP .
Table 7. Business process symbols used in workflows
Symbol Symbol name Description
Lane 1Lane 2Lane 3
Pool
Pool The pool assumes process control – in other words, it assigns the tasks. A pool consists of one or more so-called swim lanes that depict all the 
individuals or types of users that are involved in carrying out the business process or workflow. Diagrams should be clear, neat and easy for all 
viewers to understand the relationships across the different swim lanes. For example, a pool would depict the business process of conducting an 
outreach activity, which involves multiple stakeholders represented by different lanes in that pool.
A business process diagram can contain two or more pools that connect through message flows (messages received from outside of the pool). 
This indicates different process owners collaborating and exchanging information. For example, in the case of a referral, health facility A (the 
referring facility) represents the process owner that assigns internally the tasks for the actors represented as swim lanes in the pool. Health facility 
B (the receiving facility) has allocated its own pool and is considered a different process owner, with the same role. These two facilities exchange 
information relevant for a referral (client history, referral details, etc.), represented as message flows, but each facility has control only over its 
internal activities, without directly impacting the activities of the other facility.
Lane 2Lane 3
Pool
Lane 1
Swim lane Each individual or type of user is assigned to a swim lane, a designated area for noting the activities performed or expected by that specific 
actor. For example, a health worker may have one swim lane; the supervisor would be in another swim lane; and the clients or patients would be 
classified in another swim lane. 
Start event or 
trigger event
The workflow diagram should contain both a start and an end event, defining the beginning and completion of the task, respectively.
Start event 
message
This is a type of a start event. In some instances, the workflow can start with a message. A message in the business process model and notation 
does not indicate only letters, emails or calls, but also includes information exchanged between two different systems, such as data exchange, 
notifications. Any action that refers to a specific addressee and represents or contains information for the addressee is a message.
End event There can be multiple end events depicted across multiple swim lanes in a business process diagram. However, for diagram clarity, there should 
only be one end event per swim lane.
Activity, process, 
step or task
Each activity should start with a verb, for example, “register client” , “calculate risk” . Between the start and end of a workflow, there should be a 
series of activities noting the successive actions performed by the actor for that swim lane. There can also be subprocesses of each activity. 
+
Activity with 
subprocess
This denotes an activity that has a much longer subprocess to be detailed in another diagram. If the diagram starts to become too complex and 
unhelpful, the subprocess symbol should be used to reference another process depicted on another page.
Activity with 
business rule
This denotes a decision-making activity that requires the business rule, or decision-support logic, to be detailed in a decision-support table. 
This means that the logic described in the decision-support table will come into play during this activity, as outlined in the business process. This 
is usually reserved for complex decisions. 
27
Business processes and workflows
recommendationspersonasscenariosworkflowsdatadecisionsrequirements
Symbol Symbol name Description
Sequence flow This denotes the flow direction from one process to the next. The end event should not have any output arrows. All symbols (except for start 
event) may have an unlimited number of input arrows. All symbols (except for end event and gateway) should have one and only one output 
arrow, leading to a new symbol, looping back to a previously used symbol or to the end event symbol. Connecting arrows should not intersect 
(cross) each other. 
Message flow This denotes the flow of data or information from one process to another. This is usually used for when data are shared across swim lanes or 
stakeholder groups. 
Exclusive gateway This symbol is used to depict a fork, or decision point, in the workflow, which may be a simple binary (e.g. yes/no) filter with two corresponding 
output arrows, or a different set of outputs.
There should only be two different outputs that originate from the decision point. If you find yourself needing more than two output or sequence 
flow arrows, you most likely are trying to depict decision-support logic or a business rule. This should be depicted as an activity with business 
rule (above) instead.
Parallel gateway The parallel gateway can be used to model concurrency in a process. This type of gateway allows forking into multiple paths of execution or 
joining multiple incoming paths of execution. An important difference with other gateway types is that the parallel gateway does not evaluate 
conditions.
Throw – link event The throw – link event serves as the start of an off-page connector. It is the end of the process when there is no more room on your page for that 
workflow. It is the end of a process on your current page or the end of a subprocess that is part of a larger process. A catch – link will need to 
follow the throw – link. 
Catch – link event The catch – link serves as the end of an off-page connector. It is the start of the new process on a different page from the throw – link or the start 
of a subprocess that is part of a larger process. A throw – link must be aligned to the catch – link. 
~
Ad hoc marker An ad hoc subprocess can contain multiple activities (tasks or subprocesses), which can be executed in any order, executed several times or 
skipped. However, not all these activities need to be finished before moving on to the next activity.
Loop activity A loop activity indicates that the activity repeats until a defined condition either applies or ceases to apply. The condition on which a loop 
executes is included as an annotation.

IDENTIFICATION AND PREPARATION FOR SMBP PROCESS NOTES AND ANNOTATIONS
1. Identification of a hypertensive condition during ANC contact
 » The Digital adaptation kit for antenatal care: operational requirements 
for implementing WHO recommendations in digital systems (ANC DAK)(20) 
describes the clinical protocols that are relevant for diagnosing a 
hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and identifying whether signs and 
symptoms are common or if they indicate something more serious. 
Therefore, some of the data dictionary elements and decision logic 
tables in this DAK module refer to activities in the ANC DAK.
2. Determine client eligibility for SMBP
 » The health worker identifies whether the client is eligible to use an SMBP 
intervention, assessing the client’s ability to meet any criteria defined 
by the decision logic in the health worker-facing module for self-care 
interventions.
 » For the SMBP intervention, only a facility-based health worker 
determines eligibility. Also, this intervention may not be appropriate for 
all pregnant clients, even if they wish to use it.
 » The health worker requests permission for the client to share SMBP data 
from the digital personal health record to their facility-based health 
record. Alternatively, the SMBP data may be recorded on paper, and the 
client should be counselled that they will be requested to share their BP 
information. If permission is not granted, skip to Step 5 and continue 
with routine ANC contacts. Also, if the client opts out initially, they may 
change their mind, so the health worker should check in with this step 
during subsequent contacts.
3. Counsel on and propose SMBP
 » The health worker provides counselling on options for SMBP , describing 
how each of the options work, and the pros and cons of each.
4. Accepts SMBP?
 » Based on the counselling provided by the health worker (as well as any 
information learned earlier through the client’s own research), the client 
decides whether to conduct SMBP .
 » The health worker records the client’s choice in the facility record.
5. Continue facility-based monitoring and care
 » If the client chooses not to conduct SMBP , the health worker should 
continue traditional facility-based monitoring and care. 
6. Teach client how SMBP works
 » The health worker teaches the client how to conduct SMBP . The health 
worker demonstrates how to use the BP measurement device and 
personal health tracking intervention. As the client will need to use these 
tools on their own, the health worker should spend time on this step, 
including asking the client to practise using these tools in front of the 
health worker.
 » When appropriate, the health worker provides the client with training 
materials. These include links to training videos and electronic written/
visual materials that the client can access through the personal health 
tracking application, or printed handouts that the client can take home.
 » For clients using the SMBP intervention, the health worker should tell the 
client that there will be a follow-up appointment scheduled soon after 
this one, to check on how the client is doing with the BP measurement 
device.
 » The client should also be counselled on how to obtain a BP device for 
SMBP .
7. Client wishes to continue?
 » The client determines whether they wish to continue. If they do not wish 
to continue SMBP , they may continue with traditional facility-based 
monitoring at their next scheduled ANC contact.
31
Business processes and workflows
recommendationspersonasscenariosworkflowsdatadecisionsrequirements
8. Calibrate BP measurement device 
 » Health workers should calibrate the BP measurement device as needed. 
This may also include determining the cuff size and preferred arm for 
measurements. 
9. Download and set up personal health tracking application/intervention
 » Together with the health worker, the client selects and downloads a 
personal health tracking application to use and installs it on their device.
 » Some clients may need to review instructions or obtain assistance from a 
health worker, community support worker or a personal contact. Prompt 
the client to find out if this is needed and give assistance if necessary.
 » The client inputs basic health data, such as date of birth, height and 
weight. Included in this set of data is the client’s unique ID number, 
which is used on the client’s facility-based health record to enable 
accurate record look-up as well as authentication for data sharing.
 » The client should input any past or existing health conditions, as well 
as any current medications and allergies, that are relevant to the self-
monitoring intervention. If medications are input, prompt the client to 
set up reminders to ensure medication is taken regularly and to re-order 
their prescriptions.
 » Prompt the client to undertake set-up tasks for SMBP . They should also 
take a baseline BP measurement and then record this in the personal 
health tracking application.
 » Prompt the client to set up a schedule with reminders for SMBP . The 
client’s facility-based health worker will determine how frequently and 
at which times of day the BP measurements should be taken. These 
recommendations will vary depending on the client’s condition.
10. Client demonstrates SMBP procedures
 » Encourage the client to demonstrate the procedures for SMBP , so that the 
health worker can help with doubts or difficulties identified.
11. Reinforce and provide assistance as necessary
 » Determine whether the client needs assistance with any of the above 
steps. If no assistance is needed, then the client can fill the system with 
the relevant information.
 » Counsel and reinforce to the client the procedures for SMBP , including 
the need to rest before the reading, the body position, the need to empty 
the bladder, the arm position, the avoidance of speaking during the 
measurement and other relevant information.
 » Help the client on cuff positioning, as needed, and device management 
for measuring BP .
 » Some clients may need refresher training or tips on how to use the 
personal health tracking application, including how to navigate to 
specific parts of the record, how to input data, how to see results in 
different formats, etc. Ask the client if they need help using the software.
 » Prompt clients to use any tools provided to help them use the 
software effectively. Note that the software help tools should be clear, 
comprehensive, accessible, appropriate and easy to follow.
 » For some clients, written instructions may not be sufficient to help them 
use the personal health tracking application properly. In-person help 
may be preferred, especially for learning technology. Such help could 
come from a personal contact or from an organization (including a health 
facility) that aims to improve users’ digital literacy, or even to provide 
specific support for the self-monitoring intervention and the personal 
health tracking application.
12. Attend ANC follow-up contact 
 » For clients using the SMBP intervention, it is important for the health 
worker to schedule one to two follow-up appointments to check how the 
client is doing with the BP monitoring device.
 » These appointments should occur relatively soon after the initial visit. 
The BP monitoring intervention for a pregnant client who is at risk for 
pre-eclampsia will likely require a check-in within one to two days after 
the initial visit, because of the risks involved in outpatient management 
of this condition.
 » At these follow-up sessions, the health worker should discuss the 
client’s access to and usage of the BP measurement device as well as 
the personal health tracking application. The health worker should also 
coach the client on different parts of the SMBP intervention.

Business processes and workflows
recommendationspersonasscenariosworkflowsdatadecisionsrequirements
CONDUCT SMBP PROCESS NOTES AND ANNOTATIONS
1. Determine time to conduct SMBP
 » The client conducts SMBP at the agreed time. They could learn this in 
various ways: from a reminder set within the app or in another app on 
their device; a note they made on paper; their memory; or from a family 
member, caregiver, friend or other person from the community.
 » For SMBP , the client needs to wait at least 30 minutes after eating, 
drinking or being physically active before they measure their BP .
2. Update/confirm health profile
 » Prompt the client to determine whether any changes need to be made 
to the health profile they created when setting up the personal health 
tracking application.
3. Take BP measurements
 » The client takes BP measurements according to the device’s usage 
instructions. Instructions can include educational materials on 
the intervention and product instructions provided by the device 
manufacturer. Accurate data collection requires correct device use.
 » For BP monitoring, one measurement comprises an average of two 
readings taken 1–2 minutes apart.
4. Input result into personal health tracking application
 » The client inputs the self-monitoring data, such as BP measurements, 
into the personal health tracking application. In cases where the client is 
using a smart connected device, this step may be automated. 
 » Some clients may need to review instructions or obtain assistance from a 
health worker, community support worker or a personal contact.
5. Assistance needed?
 » Client assesses if they need assistance with any of the prior steps.
6. Obtain assistance as needed
 » The client obtains assistance with using the BP measurement device, the 
personal health tracking application or both. Find out what questions or 
concerns the client has when self-monitoring.
 – Is it difficult for them to access a BP device?
 – Are they having problems using the BP device?
 – Do they understand the device usage instructions?
 – Do they need help setting it up?
 – Do they need to learn how to use it correctly, or have a refresher 
lesson?
 – Do they need help determining how to read the results?
 – Are they having trouble remembering to self-monitor at the right time?
 – Is it difficult for them to access a device with a personal health 
tracking application on it?
 – Are they having problems using the personal health tracking 
application on their device?
 – Do they need help inputting information?
 – Do they wish to discuss the health actions suggested by the personal 
health tracking application?
 » Coach client on conducting SMBP
 – Provide the client with support to use the device or app based on the 
issues or questions noted.
 – To check for client comprehension and confidence in using the device 
or app, ask the client to demonstrate how they use the device.
 – If you train or retrain the client on the proper use of the device or app, 
have them demonstrate usage afterwards.
 – Provide educational materials on SMBP , if available.
 » Some clients may need refresher training or tips on how to use the 
personal health tracking application, including how to navigate to 
specific parts of the record, how to input data, how to see results in 
different formats.
34
Digital adaptation kit for self-monitoring of blood pressure during pregnancy
recommendationspersonasscenariosworkflowsdatadecisionsrequirements
7. Review-health actions 
 » Application provides health action(s) based on the SMBP data and 
various inputs pertaining to the client’s individual health condition, 
health history, personal information, needs or preferences.
8. Action needed?
 » This depends on whether the client needs to perform health actions 
provided by the personal health tracking application in response to the 
self-monitoring measurement results. One health action could simply be 
to continue self-monitoring.
 » If additional interventions are not needed, the client continues to 
conduct SMBP .
9. Seek health-care assistance
 » The client seeks the care services needed for further information about 
the health condition for which they are self-monitoring.
 » This step might occur in parallel with others within this workflow since 
the client may seek further information at different times while self-
monitoring.
 » If a health-care product is needed for the additional self-care 
intervention that the health action recommends, help the client to 
determine what is needed and provide information on these products.
 » Discuss health actions from the personal health tracking application.
 – Find out if the client needs more information or clarification about 
the suggested health actions provided by the personal health tracking 
application in response to the self-monitoring data inputs.
 – Do they understand the health action(s) and information?
 – Do they have concerns or questions about the health action(s)?
 – Do they face any barriers in performing the health action(s)?
 – How interested are they in performing the action(s)?
 – Note that the level of information provided will vary depending upon 
the health worker cadre and their training.
10. Share SMBP data
 » If the client has opted in for electronic data transfer, and the information 
and communications technology infrastructure supports it, transfer the 
SMBP data from the client’s personal health tracking application to their 
facility-based health record. If not, the health worker can copy the data 
by hand into the paper registers or records during the ANC contact.
11. Repeat SMBP
 » The client continues SMBP , returning to the start of this workflow at the 
time of their next measurement event up until their next scheduled ANC 
contact/SMBP follow-up appointment.

Business process C. ANC contact with additional considerations for SMBP
Objective: To counsel and provide routine ANC services to pregnant women. The workflow for these business processes can be seen in Figure 8 (see ANC DAK 
Business process B. ANC contact [20] for more information). Additional considerations within Activity 10 (Counselling, in-facility management and treatment) 
include:
 » The health worker reviews the client’s self-monitoring data, either within the facility-based client record (or community health information system) if the data 
were transferred, or directly in the digital HB/PHR if the client opted out of data transfer.
 » The health worker first-lines a quality check on the data. The health worker asks the client about any missing days of data, recording any relevant information.
 » Based on the client assessment and the review of the self-monitoring data, the health worker provides counselling on the health condition that is being self-
monitored by the client.
 » The counselling should be appropriate to the health worker’s cadre level and the topics discussed will vary by intervention and by a client’s specific needs.

Additional considerations for adapting workflows
As a reminder, these workflows are meant to be generic and high level. They will require a level of customization and adaptation as they are being translated into a 
digital system for a specific context. These workflows are considered to be around 80% complete, whereby the other 20% will need to be completed through a series 
of human-centred design methods and mechanisms to complete the workflows for implementation. Although these workflows can be considered as a starting 
point, it is helpful to conduct further validation through interviews with the targeted personas to obtain a better sense of the differences that would need to be 
reflected in the digital system.
37
recommendationspersonasscenariosworkflowsdatadecisionsrequirements
This section outlines the minimum set of data corresponding to different points of the workflow within the identified business processes. This data set can be 
used on any software system and lists the data elements relevant for service delivery and executing decision-support logic, and for populating indicators and 
performance metrics. Although this section provides a high-level overview of the data elements, a more complete data dictionary in spreadsheet form detailing the 
input options, validation checks and concept dictionary codes is available here (https://smart.who.int/dak-smbp/dictionary.html).
Inclusion of a data element in the table does not by itself indicate that collection of the data is required. Additionally, some data elements are dependent on other 
data elements, feasibility of their inclusion, and contextual factors.
Simplified list of core data elements
Tables 8 and 9 provide simplified lists of core data elements and are merely snapshots of the comprehensive data dictionary. As with the workflows, this data 
dictionary is considered 80% generic with the expectation that the other 20% will be supplemented and modified through adaptation for the appropriate context 
and type of end user.

The decision-support logic component of the DAK provides the decision logics and algorithms, and the scheduling of services, in accordance with WHO guidelines. 
In this DAK, the decision logics and algorithms deconstruct the recommendations for SMBP in pregnancy into a format that clearly labels the inputs and outputs that 
would be operationalized in a digital decision-support system.
Decision-support logic overview
Table 10 provides an overview of the decision-support tables and algorithms for the SMBP in pregnancy business processes. The structure of the decision-support 
tables is based on an adaptation of the Decision Model and Notation (DMN), an industry standard for modelling and executing decision logic (43). These decision-
support tables detail the business rules, data inputs and outputs to support SMBP in pregnancy module.

Decision-support tables
Each of the decision logics listed in the overview table is elaborated in the decision-support implementation tool found here (https://smart.who.int/dak-smbp/
decision-logic.html). These decision-support tables include the components described in Table 11. Table 12 is an example of a decision-support logic table for 
danger signs as an example.
Note that the decision-support logic is translated directly from the WHO guidelines and guidance documents and has been reviewed by the panel of experts who 
have created these guidelines. Although some level of adaptation may be needed depending on changes to the workflow or changes to the data dictionary, any 
changes to the decision-support logic should be considered carefully because an embedded decision-support system can greatly affect the quality of care. As 
helpful as decision-support logic can be to the health worker or client, an incorrect decision-support logic can also be detrimental. Thus, any new decision-support 
logic should be carefully reviewed and agreed upon by in-country clinical experts.
Table 11. Components of the decision tables
Decision ID The name of the decision describing what algorithm or logic is represented (e.g. health actions from SMBP measurement). The decision ID should 
correspond to the number in the overview table above. 
Business rule The description of the decision that needs to be made based on IF/THEN statements with the appropriate data element name for the variables. The rule 
should demonstrate the relationship between the input variables and the expected outputs and actions within the decision-support logic (e.g. if BP is 
higher than 160 systolic BP/110 diastolic BP , then the client should go to the closest health facility right away).
Trigger The event that would indicate when this decision-support logic should appear within the workflow , such as the activity that would trigger this 
decision to be made. 
Input(s) Output Action Annotations
These are the variables 
or conditions that 
need to be considered 
to determine the 
consequent actions or 
outputs. 
If there are multiple input 
entries on the same row, 
these different inputs 
are considered as AND 
conditions that need to be 
in place at the same time. 
The resulting action or decision based 
on the combination of input entries. 
This the statement that immediately 
follows the THEN. Examples of outputs 
may include a qualitative measure 
of the client’s blood pressure (BP) 
level (e.g. high or not high), whether 
contextual data are required to 
accompany the self-monitoring of 
blood pressure (SMBP) measurement, 
the presence of pregnancy danger 
signs and eligibility for the SMBP 
intervention. Note that some outputs 
are system variables for use in other 
decision-support tables.
Concrete measures to be taken based on 
the output (e.g. contact a health worker, try 
a self-care intervention [to manage routine 
symptoms of pregnancy]). In some cases, 
output and action may be the same. Some 
outputs may yield multiple actions, each 
denoted in a separate column. Actions with the 
first word in sentence case versus all capital 
letters (e.g. use versus USE) are actions that 
the client should undertake. Actions with the 
first word in all capital letters are actions that 
the system should take.
Additional explanations or descriptions, 
including possible pop-up alert messages and 
relevant background information. This section 
can also include the written content that would 
appear in the pop-up messages notifying the 
client on the appropriate health actions to 
take and, in some cases, the reason for these 
recommended actions. This can include health 
information to accompany the action to provide 
context and motivation for the client to take 
the health action, referrals to a health worker, 
facility or community organization, or health 
information to explain the self-monitoring result.
Inputs placed on different rows are considered as OR 
conditions that can be considered independently of 
the inputs on other rows. 
BP: blood pressure; SMBP: self-monitoring of blood pressure.

This section provides an overview of illustrative functional and non-functional requirements that may be considered to kick-start the process of designing or 
adapting the personal health tracking application. Functional requirements describe the capabilities the system must have to meet the end users’ needs and 
achieve tasks within the business process. Non-functional requirements provide the general attributes and features of the digital system to ensure usability and 
overcome technical and physical constraints. Examples of non-functional requirements include ability to work offline, multiple language settings and password 
protection.
Table 13 highlights some key functional requirements for executing the business processes listed in Component 4 of this document. Table 14 provides 
non-functional requirements as general characteristics of the overall system. The complete set of functional and non-functional requirements can be accessed in the 
functional and non-functional requirements implementation tool, available here (https://smart.who.int/dak-smbp/system-requirements.html). Please note that 
these are not exhaustive lists and should be modified according to context and user persona needs.

Preface
Adolescent pregnancy remains a global public health 
concern with wide-reaching impacts on adolescents 
health, education and future opportunities. 
Adolescents who give birth face higher risks of 
maternal and infant mortality compared with 
older women, while early pregnancies can restrict 
adolescents' choices, limiting their educational 
and economic prospects. These limitations often 
perpetuate cycles of poverty and inequality.
In many parts of the world, adolescents – whether 
married or unmarried – lack access to the information 
and resources necessary to make informed decisions 
about their sexual and reproductive health (SRH). 
This leaves them vulnerable to early pregnancies 
and unprepared to navigate the physical, emotional 
and social changes that follow. Child marriage, 
which remains prevalent in certain regions, further 
exacerbates these risks. Marrying before the age of 
18 increases the likelihood of early and repeated 
pregnancies, contributes to poor mental health, and 
can lead to early school dropout, further restricting 
life choices. 
Yet, there is also much to celebrate. Significant 
progress has been made in reducing adolescent 
pregnancy and child marriage globally. Between 
2000 and 2021, the global adolescent birth rate fell 
by 34%, and between 2010 and 2020 child marriage 
declined by 24%. These improvements underscore 
the fact that adolescent pregnancy and child 
marriage are preventable when multisectoral efforts 
come together. Comprehensive SRH education has 
played a key role in driving these advances, alongside 
supportive policies and programmes. But progress 
is uneven, and we must sustain efforts to ensure that 
the most vulnerable groups of adolescent girls are not 
left behind.
The global community has reaffirmed its commitment 
to advancing adolescent sexual and reproductive 
health and rights (SRHR) through initiatives such 
as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 
the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and 
Adolescents’ Health. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) has remained at the forefront of this 
effort, for instance through the publication of the 
WHO recommendations on adolescent sexual and 
reproductive health and rights (2018).
Recognizing the need to build on existing 
achievements and respond to evolving evidence, 
World Health Organization (WHO) is proud to present 
the updated WHO guideline on preventing early 
pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among 
adolescents in low- and middle-income countries. 
Originally published in 2011, this updated guideline 
is essential to ensure that policies and programmes 
reflect the realities adolescents face today, promoting 
bodily autonomy, informed decision-making and 
access to services that support their rights. By 
implementing these recommendations, we will 
continue to strengthen the foundation for healthier 
and more equitable societies where every adolescent 
can thrive.
Ensuring that adolescents have the information, 
resources and support to exercise their SRHR is not 
only a matter of health – it is a matter of justice. All 
adolescents need to be empowered to make choices 
that lead to healthier, more fulfilling lives.

Executive summary
Background
Adolescent pregnancy is a worldwide 
phenomenon, albeit with variations between 
and within countries. It continues to have 
serious and lasting consequences. There 
is an imbalance between efforts to prevent 
adolescent pregnancy and efforts to respond 
to the needs of pregnant and parenting 
girls and their families. Although normative 
documents, policies and programmes are 
more likely to be based on sound data and 
evidence than in the past, this is still a work 
in progress.
In the 13 years since the publication of the 2011 
guideline, more research evidence and programmatic 
experience have been generated. The field has 
transitioned from a focus on addressing the needs 
of all adolescents, to addressing the needs of groups 
of adolescents depending on their particular needs 
and circumstances. Based on these developments, 
stakeholders within and outside the United Nations 
expressed in a variety of fora that the guideline served 
a useful purpose and called for it to be updated.
Objectives
The objectives of this updated edition of the WHO 
guidelines on preventing early pregnancy and poor 
reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and 
middle-income countries are the same as those of 
the 2011 edition, namely to provide evidence-based 
normative guidance on interventions to improve 
adolescent morbidity and mortality by reducing 
the chances of early pregnancy and its resulting 
poor health outcomes. The specific objectives of the 
guideline were to:
1. identify effective interventions to prevent early 
pregnancy by influencing factors such as early 
marriage, coerced sex, unsafe abortion, access 
to contraceptives and access to maternal health 
services by adolescents; and 
2. provide an analytical framework for policy-makers 
and programme managers to use when selecting 
evidence-based interventions to prevent early 
pregnancy and negative health outcomes when 
they occur that are most appropriate for the needs 
of their countries and context. 
Intended audience
The primary intended audience for the updated 
guideline is the same as those of the 2011 edition, 
namely, policy leaders/planners and programme 
managers from government, nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs), and agencies that provide 
technical and financial support in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs). Secondary audiences 
include health workers, researchers, government 
officials, professional associations, programme 
managers and advocacy groups. Finally, the updated 
guideline is also intended for young professionals 
belonging to the above groups, and for young people 
in general.
Methods
This guideline was developed according to 
World Health Organization (WHO) standards 
and requirements for guideline development, 
and with the oversight of the WHO Guidelines 
Review Committee.
All of the recommendations in this guideline were 
developed by the Guideline Development Group 
(GDG), facilitated by the guideline methodologist 
using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
xi
Executive summary
See the Introduction and Annex 3, which describe 
how the specific recommendations and good 
practice statements included in this guideline 
were determined.
One notable change in the updated edition of the 
guideline is the inclusion of good practice statements. 
Good practice statements may be issued when the 
quality of evidence for an intervention is low or 
very low, but when there is high certainty based on 
indirect evidence and/or expert opinion that the 
intervention does more benefit than harm and when 
not implementing the intervention would be contrary 
to practice norms. In terms of implementation, good 
practice statements should be viewed as equivalent 
to strong recommendations. This updated 
edition contains three good practice statements 
in the section on preventing child marriage and 
supporting the needs and rights of married girls, 
and four good practice statements in the section on 
improving access to, uptake of, and continued use of 
contraception among adolescents (see Table 1).
Table 1. Summary of recommendations
1. Preventing child marriage and responding to the needs and rights of married girls
Recommendation 1.1 WHO recommends the implementation of interventions to empower girls 
by building their knowledge, skills, assets and social networks. 
(Conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 1.2 WHO recommends that programmes aiming to reduce child marriage 
and support married girls engage with parents/guardians, boys and men, 
and the broader community to create and sustain a gender-equitable and 
enabling environment. 
(Conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 1.3 WHO recommends offering conditional incentives (conditioned on school 
attendance and/or remaining unmarried) as a broad strategy to increase 
educational attainment and reduce child marriage as a part of social 
protection interventions for girls at highest risk of child marriage.
(Conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 1.4 WHO recommends the implementation of interventions to remove gender-
related barriers to education and ensure girls’ completion of 12 years of 
quality education.
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 1.5 WHO recommends the implementation of interventions aimed at the 
economic empowerment of girls to improve their financial literacy, 
access to savings, and employment skills and prospects, and to expand 
alternatives to marriage before age 18. 
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 1.6 WHO recommends the formulation and implementation of laws that 
restrict marriage before age 18, consistent with human rights standards.
(Conditional recommendation; very-low-certainty evidence)
xii
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
Good practice statement 1.1 Political, governmental, religious, traditional and other influential leaders 
should be mobilized to support the prevention of child marriage and 
promotion of girls’ rights.
Good practice statement 1.2 Efforts to address the needs and rights of women and girls should 
recognize and address the specific needs and rights of ever-married girls 
and those in formal or informal unions.
Good practice statement 1.3 Adolescents, including those who are ever married or in formal or informal 
unions, should be meaningfully engaged in the design, implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation of efforts to address their needs and rights.
2. Increasing access to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception among adolescents
Recommendation 2.1a WHO recommends the implementation of gender-transformative 
behaviour change interventions with adolescents to strengthen their 
ability to make decisions about their contraceptive use. 
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 2.1b WHO recommends the implementation of interventions to shift gender and 
other social norms to support contraceptive decision-making and access 
to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception among adolescents. 
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
xiii
Executive summary
Recommendation 2.2 WHO carried forward the recommendations in the WHO guideline on self-
care interventions for health and well-being, 2022 revision that are relevant 
to adolescents’ access to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception.1 
These recommendations include:
Self-administered injectable contraception should be made available as an 
additional approach to deliver injectable contraception for individuals of 
reproductive age.
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Over-the-counter oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) should be made available 
without a prescription for individuals using OCPs.
(Strong recommendation; very-low-certainty evidence)
Over-the-counter emergency contraceptive pills should be made 
available without a prescription to individuals who wish to use 
emergency contraception.
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
The consistent and correct use of male and female condoms is highly 
effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV; reducing the risk 
of HIV transmission both from men to women and women to men in 
serodiscordant couples; reducing the risk of acquiring other sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs) and associated conditions, including genital 
warts and cervical cancer; and preventing unintended pregnancy.
Provide up to one year’s supply of pills, depending on the woman’s 
preference and anticipated use. Programmes must balance the desirability 
of giving women maximum access to pills with concerns regarding 
contraceptive supply and logistics. The resupply system should be flexible, 
so that the woman can obtain pills easily in the amount and at the time she 
requires them.
Recommendation 2.3 WHO recommends the implementation of interventions to reduce financial 
barriers related to access to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception 
among adolescents.
(Conditional recommendation; very-low-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 2.4 WHO recommends the implementation of accurate and safe digital health 
interventions for adolescents as part of sexual and reproductive health 
(SRH) programming. 
(Conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)
Good practice statement 2.1 Political, governmental, religious, traditional and other influential leaders 
should be mobilized to support the access to, uptake of, and continued use 
of contraception among adolescents.

WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
Good practice statement 2.2 Interventions to improve the quality of health services should be 
implemented to improve access to, uptake of, and continued use of 
contraception among adolescents. 
Good practice statement 2.3 Enabling laws and policies on age, marital status and consent procedures 
in relation to sexual activity, access to sexual and reproductive health 
(SRH) services and access to specific contraceptive methods, should be 
coherently formulated and implemented to improve access to, uptake of, 
and continued use of contraception among adolescents. 
Good practice statement 2.4 Adolescents should be meaningfully engaged in the design, 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of efforts to address their 
contraceptive needs and rights.
What is similar and what is 
different
Rationale: 
The rationale for this guideline is similar to the 
2011 edition of the guideline. However, given the 
progress made globally in reducing child marriage 
and increasing the access to, uptake of, and continued 
use of contraception among adolescents, there is a 
stronger focus on groups who have not benefited 
from this progress.
Objectives: 
The overall objective for this guideline is unchanged 
from the 2011 edition.
Intended audience: 
The intended audience for this guideline is 
unchanged from the 2011 edition.
Scope: 
The scope of this guideline is reduced as compared 
with the 2011 edition. Given that separate guidelines 
have been developed on four of the six outcomes 
included in the 2011 edition, this update focuses 
on the remaining two objectives: preventing child 
marriage and responding to the needs and rights of 
married girls, and improving access to, uptake of, and 
continued use of contraception among adolescents.
Guideline development process:
The guideline development process for this guideline 
was similar to that used for the 2011 edition. 
However, the process for this edition involved 
teams representing different stakeholder groups – 
government, NGOs, academics and young people – 
from one country in each of WHO’s regions, selected 
in conjunction with our regional offices, as members 
of the External Review Group. In addition to the young 
people who were part of these six country teams, 
representatives of global networks/organizations 
working for and led by young people were included in 
the Guideline Development Group (GDG).
Population, intervention, comparator and outcomes 
(PICO) questions:
The PICO questions for this guideline are similar to 
those in the 2011 edition. However, on child marriage, 
this edition includes two new PICO questions – one 
on responding to the health and social needs and 
rights of married girls and another on the meaningful 
engagement of young people in efforts intended to 
benefit them. On improving access to, uptake of, and 
continued use of contraception, this edition of the 
guideline includes two new PICO questions – one 
on digital health interventions and another on the 
meaningful engagement of young people in efforts 
intended to benefit them. In the 2011 edition of the 
guideline, the PICO question on self-care did not 
explicitly refer to self-care; the PICO question in this 
edition does so. The wording of some PICO questions 
for both sections was revised without substantial 
changes to their meaning.
Recommendations and good practice statements:
The 2011 edition of the guideline did not contain 
good practice statements. This edition contains three 
on child marriage and four on improving access 
to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception. 
Additionally, the 2011 edition of the guideline 
included both action and research recommendations. 
xv
Executive summary
This edition does not include the latter, because 
separate but linked research priority-setting exercises 
are under way.
Analytic frameworks for selecting evidence-based 
interventions for implementation
This guideline contains an additional section 
that provides an overview of analytic frameworks 
for selecting evidence-based interventions for 
implementation. Specifically, it guides readers to 
set priorities (balancing efforts to achieve global 
targets with those to understand and respond to local 
needs), employ an explicit and directive equity focus 
to leave no one behind, and monitor and evaluate 
programmes and projects.
Plan to disseminate the guideline 
and support its application
The following approaches will be used to raise 
awareness and interest in this updated edition of the 
guideline, to build capacity for its use, and to support 
countries directly. First, awareness of and interest 
in the updated guideline will be built using media, 
including social media, targeted email outreach and 
briefings (e.g. with technical and funding agencies), 
publishing articles in peer-reviewed journals and 
newsletters, and contributing to conferences and 
seminars, both in person and virtually. Second, 
capacity will be built for the application of the 
guideline through in-person and virtual seminars 
that share the recommendations, their implications 
for the field, and their basis in research evidence and 
programmatic experience. Alongside this, practical 
examples of their application in different country 
contexts will be shared. Third, direct support to 
countries will be provided through partnerships 
such as Family Planning 2030 and Girls Not Brides. 
These activities will be conducted in collaboration 
with WHO’s regional and country offices; partners 
within the United Nations system, notably the United 
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 
UN Women and Joint United Nations Programme 
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS); and other partners, including 
academic institutions, professional associations 
and NGOs.

2017;91:47-53 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2017.08.009). 
Plan to fill evidence gaps
The evidence reviews conducted to inform this 
updated edition of the guideline identified numerous 
research studies and evaluations that were published 
in the 13 years since the 2011 edition was published. 
However, there are still substantial gaps in the 
evidence either because some issues have yet to be 
addressed or have been addressed inadequately, or 
because of the way in which the studies/evaluations 
have been carried out and reported. As a result, the 
number of studies that could be included as part of 
the GRADE process was limited, and the strength of 
evidence was downgraded in some studies. These 
evidence gaps will feed into the separate but linked 
research priority-setting exercises that are under 
way. Future research studies and evaluations should 
be analysed and reported in a way that enables their 
findings to be included in future GRADE processes.
Plan to review and update the 
guideline
As in the case of this edition of the guideline, a 
decision on future updates will be based on an 
assessment of its need. Future updates will follow 
WHO’s standards and requirements for guideline 
development, including the possibility of utilizing  
a living guideline approach.2

CHAPTER 1
Introduction

1. Introduction
This chapter provides key background 
information about child marriage and 
adolescent contraceptive use and an 
overview of the guideline, including 
brief summaries of its scope, how it was 
developed and its intended use.
1.1 Background
1.1.1 What is the situation of adolescent 
pregnancy and childbearing today, and how 
has it evolved over the last two decades?
Levels and trends in adolescent pregnancy 
and childbearing
Adolescent girls aged 15–19 years in low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs) have an estimated 
21 million pregnancies each year, 50% of which are 
unintended (1). In 2021, an estimated 12.1 million girls 
aged 15–19 years and 499 000 girls aged 10–14 years 
gave birth globally (2).
Worldwide, the adolescent birth rate decreased 
from 64.5 births per 1000 women aged 15–19 years 
in 2000 to 42.5 births per 1000 women of the same 
age in 2021. However, rates of change have been 
uneven across different regions of the world, with the 
sharpest decline occurring in Southern, Central, and 
Western Asia and North Africa, and slower declines in 
Latin American and the Caribbean and sub-Saharan 
Africa (3, 4). Although declines have occurred in all 
regions, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and 
the Caribbean continue to have the highest rates 
globally at 101 and 53.2 births per 1000, respectively 
in 2021 (3). There are also substantial differences 
in rates between countries within regions. In Latin 
America and the Caribbean, for example, Nicaragua 
reported 85.6 births per 1000 adolescent girls in 
2021, compared to 24.1 per 1000 adolescent girls 
in Chile (3). Even within countries there are large 
variations. For example, in Zambia, the percentage of 
adolescent girls aged 15–19 years who have begun 
childbearing (women who are either pregnant or 
who have had a birth) ranged from 14.9% in Lusaka 
to 42.5% in the Southern Province in 2018 (5). In the 
Philippines, the percentage of girls aged 15-19 years 
who have begun childbearing ranged from 3.5% in 
the Cordillera Administrative Region to 17.9% in the 
Davao Peninsula Region in 2017 (6).
While the estimated global adolescent birth rate has 
declined, the actual number of births to adolescent 
girls continues to be high. The largest number of 
estimated births to girls aged 15–19 years in 2021 
occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (6 114 000), whereas 
far fewer births occurred in Central Asia (68 000). The 
corresponding number for girls aged 10–14 years was 
332 000 in sub-Saharan Africa, compared to 22 000 in 
South-East Asia in the same year (3).
The contexts in which adolescent pregnancies 
and childbearing occur
Adolescent pregnancies are a global problem 
occurring in high-, middle- and low-income countries. 
Studies of risk and protective factors related to 
adolescent pregnancy in LMICs indicate that levels 
tend to be higher among girls with less education 
and/or of low economic status (7, 8). Progress in 
reducing adolescent first births has been particularly 
slow among these groups, leading to increasing and 
continuing inequities (9).
Several factors contribute to adolescent pregnancies 
and births. First, in many contexts, girls are under 
pressure to marry and bear children. Child marriage 
– marriage before the age of 18 years – places girls 
at increased risk of pregnancy, with girls who are 
married early often having limited autonomy to 
influence decision-making about contraceptive 
use and the timing of childbearing (10). Globally, 
child marriage has declined over the last decade 
2
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
from approximately 25% in 2010 to 19% in 2020. 
Progress has been most marked in South Asia and 
to a lesser extent in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle 
East and Northern Africa, and Eastern Europe and 
Central Asia. However, 1 in 20 girls around the world 
is married before age 15, and the estimated global 
number of married girls was still 650 million in 2021 
(11, 12). Additionally, there is evidence of growing 
inequities; for example, while child marriage has 
decreased among girls from the wealthiest quintiles 
in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, it has 
increased among girls from the poorest quintiles 
(13). Second, in many settings girls choose to become 
pregnant because they have limited educational 
and employment prospects. Often, in such contexts, 
motherhood – within or outside marriage/union – is 
valued, and marriage or union and childbearing 
may be the best of the limited options available to 
adolescent girls (14).
Across settings, access to accurate and up-to-
date information and education about sexuality, 
reproduction and sexual and reproductive health 
and rights (SRHR) is limited. This has important 
consequences. First, many adolescents are poorly 
informed about the physical and emotional changes 
that take place during puberty, and are unprepared 
to deal with them. Second, many adolescents are 
unaware and ill-equipped to protect themselves from 
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended 
pregnancies, and to have sex safely and pleasurably 
when sexual activity begins – generally during 
adolescence (15). They may also be ill-prepared to 
refuse unwanted sex from peers or from influential 
adults who use physical or emotional pressure to 
coerce them. Finally, they may not know where and 
how to seek help from their families and from health, 
social and legal services when problems occur (16).
In many contexts, contraceptives are not easily 
accessible to adolescents. Even when contraception 
is available, adolescents may face stigma when 
seeking contraceptives, lack the agency or the 
resources to pay for them, and lack the knowledge 
of where to obtain them and how to use them 
correctly. Further, they are often at higher risk 
of discontinuing contraceptive use due to side-
effects, and due to changing life circumstances and 
reproductive intentions (16). Restrictive laws and 
policies regarding the provision of contraceptives 
based on age or marital status pose an important 
barrier to the provision and uptake of contraceptives 
among adolescents. This is often combined with 
health worker bias and/or lack of willingness to 
acknowledge adolescents’ sexual and reproductive 
health (SRH) needs and rights (17).
Globally, the proportion of adolescent girls aged 15–
19 years whose needs for contraception were satisfied 
by modern methods rose from approximately 49% 
to 60% between 2010 and 2020. The aggregate level 
of modern contraceptive use in adolescents aged 
15–19 years increased from 17.8% in 2000–2006 to 
27.2% in 2013–2017; however, this is notably lower 
than the level among adult women aged 20–34 years, 
which increased from 30.9% in 2000–2006 to 40.3% in 
2013–2017. Additionally, both the levels and trends of 
contraceptive use have been uneven across regions. 
Latin America and the Caribbean, and Eastern Europe 
and Central Asia had the highest levels of demand for 
contraception satisfied by modern methods (> 70%) 
in 2020, a relative increase of approximately 8% from 
2010 (65%) (12).
Child sexual abuse and intimate partner violence 
increase the risk of unintended pregnancy. An 
estimated 120 million girls aged under 20 years have 
experienced some form of forced sexual contact (18). 
Likewise, the estimated global prevalence of physical 
or sexual intimate partner violence against ever-
partnered adolescent girls aged 15–19 years is 24% 
in their lifetime and 16% in the past year, with wide 
variation by region (19). This abuse is deeply rooted 
in gender inequality; it affects more girls than boys, 
although many boys are also affected. 
What is the state of the global response to 
adolescent pregnancy and childbearing, and 
how has this evolved in the 30 years since 
the International Conference on Population 
and Development?
There has been increased awareness of the need 
to address adolescent pregnancy and childbearing 
in countries around the world for over 50 years 
(20). However, the issue did not get the attention 
it deserved until it was placed on the global 
public health and social development agendas 
by the International Conference on Population 
and Development (ICPD) in 1994. This enabled 
international organizations and grassroots champions 
to press governments to pay attention to this issue. 
3
1. Introduction
The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were 
announced in 2000. Goal 5 on reducing maternal 
mortality provided a new impetus for the work on 
preventing early pregnancy and childbearing in 
adolescents. United Nations agencies and other 
international organizations pressed for attention to 
adolescent pregnancy (and to HIV in adolescents 
and young people as part of Goal 6) and strived 
to stimulate and support policy and programme 
development in countries. Despite concerted efforts, 
there was little engagement because, in the first 
decade of the MDG era, adolescent health was not 
seen as a high priority (21).
In the early 2010s, there was growing realization 
worldwide that adolescents were being left behind, 
and that this had implications not only for their health 
and well-being but also for efforts to reduce maternal 
and child mortality. International organizations 
responded with data on the scope of the problem, 
as well as policy and programme guidance based 
on research studies and project experiences. They 
also used the platforms set up by the ICPD and 
the MDGs to pay greater attention to the SRHR of 
adolescents (21).
In the last five years of the MDG era (i.e. 2011–
2014), Girls Not Brides, a global partnership of 
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the 
newly established UNFPA–UNICEF Global Programme 
to End Child Marriage, injected energy and resources 
to strengthen ongoing efforts to end child marriage. 
Likewise, Family Planning 2020, a global partnership 
to put family planning at the centre of global health, 
development and gender equality, initiated efforts to 
support countries to include adolescent contraceptive 
use in their national commitments (21).
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 
updated Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and 
Adolescents’ Health (2016–2030), which were both 
launched in 2015, placed adolescents at the centre 
of the agenda. Adolescent pregnancy prevention is 
on the agenda of the SDGs and the ICPD+25 (21); it 
is also solidly positioned on the agenda of regional 
political bodies (22). Over the years, research evidence 
and programmatic experience have been built, and 
this has informed policy and programme support 
tools (23-25). Global partnerships, such as Family 
Planning 2020 and its successor Family Planning 
2030, are encouraging and supporting countries 
to develop bold and innovative commitments (26). 
Global financing institutions, such as the Global 
Financing Facility (GFF), are providing countries with 
resources to translate their plans into action (27). 
They and others, such as the Global Fund to fight 
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global Fund), 
are pressing for stronger synergies between HIV and 
adolescent pregnancy prevention programmes (28). 
Global initiatives, such as The Challenge Initiative, are 
supporting countries to translate country aspirations 
into context-specific programmes, delivered at 
scale with quality and equity, and to make full use 
of approaches such as self-care and the direct-to-
consumer movement (29). There is much more to 
be done. There are both enormous opportunities to 
exploit and challenges to overcome, but the prospects 
for progress for adolescents are better today than 
ever before. 
How has WHO contributed to the overall global 
effort, and what is its specific role?
WHO has contributed to the evolving field of 
adolescent pregnancy and childbearing for over 25 
years. The organization began by making the case 
for attention to and investment in this area. It next 
set out evidence-based guidance on what needed 
to be done to address these issues. For example, 
WHO developed an Orientation programme on 
adolescent health for health-care providers in 2006 to 
strengthen the abilities of health workers and health 
facilities to respond to adolescents effectively and 
with sensitivity, and it published WHO guidelines on 
preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive 
outcomes in adolescents in developing countries in 
2011 (24, 30). WHO also used the forum of the World 
Health Assembly to advocate for the application 
of the guidelines in a session on “Early marriages, 
and adolescent and young pregnancies” in 2012. 
Since then, WHO has supported countries to develop 
national policies and strategies on preventing child 
marriage and improving access to, uptake of, and 
continued use of contraception among adolescents. 
This has included: publishing country profiles 
synthesizing available data; distilling evidence 
of what works and what does not; documenting 
analytic case studies of “positive deviant” countries 
that have demonstrated success in reducing levels 
of child marriage and adolescent childbearing; 
stimulating and supporting implementation research; 
building the capacity of researchers, policy-makers 
and programmers from the global South; and 
setting up an innovative mechanism to provide 
4
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
technical assistance to countries that is responsive 
to their needs, and is timely, effective, efficient, and 
contributes to strengthening national capacity. All 
this work has been done in close collaboration with 
partners within and outside the United Nations.
In summary, WHO works with partners to advocate 
for attention to adolescents, build the evidence and 
epidemiologic base for action, develop and test 
programme support tools, build capacity, and support 
countries to address adolescent pregnancy effectively 
in the context of their national programmes.
1.2 Rationale for the guidelines
The rationale for the development of the 2011 
WHO guidelines on preventing early pregnancy and 
poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents 
in developing countries (24) was as follows. First, 
adolescent pregnancy was recognized as a worldwide 
phenomenon, albeit with differing levels in different 
countries, and within countries. Second, its serious 
and lasting negative health, educational and social 
consequences for girls, their children, their families 
and communities were acknowledged. Third, while 
some efforts were under way to prevent adolescent 
pregnancy, little was being done to respond to 
the needs of pregnant and parenting adolescents. 
Fourth, while a growing number of governments 
had formulated national policies and strategies to 
address adolescent pregnancy, there were gaps and 
weaknesses in their normative documents, and even 
more importantly there were gaps between policies 
and strategies on the one hand, and implementation 
on the other. Finally, governments and NGOs working 
to address adolescent pregnancy in LMICs, and the 
agencies supporting them, requested evidence-based 
guidance from WHO to inform their work.
WHO decided to develop an updated edition of the 
2011 guideline for the following three reasons. First, 
in the 12 years since its publication, more research 
evidence and programmatic experience have been 
generated, including in some of the areas in which the 
2011 guideline indicated that there was limited or no 
evidence that met the inclusion criteria. Second, the 
field has transitioned from a focus on addressing the 
needs of all adolescents to addressing the needs of 
groups of adolescents based on their particular needs 
and circumstances. Third, stakeholders in a variety of 
fora within and outside the United Nations indicated 
that the 2011 guidelines served a useful purpose and 
called for them to be updated.
1.3 Objectives of the guideline
The objectives of this updated edition of the WHO 
guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor 
reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and 
middle-income countries are the same as those of 
the 2011 edition, namely to provide evidence-based 
normative guidance on interventions to improve 
adolescent morbidity and mortality by reducing the 
chances of early pregnancy and its resulting poor 
health outcomes (24).
The specific objectives of the guideline are to:
1. identify effective interventions to prevent early 
pregnancy by influencing factors such as early 
marriage, coerced sex, unsafe abortion, access 
to contraceptives and access to maternal health 
services by adolescents; and
2. provide an analytical framework for policy-makers 
and programme managers to use when selecting 
evidence-based interventions to prevent early 
pregnancy and negative health outcomes when 
they occur that are most appropriate for the needs 
of their countries and contexts. 
1.4 Scope of the guideline
The scope of the 2011 edition of the WHO guideline 
on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive 
outcomes among adolescents in developing countries 
is reflected in its objectives. These are: (i) to prevent 
adolescent pregnancy through preventing child 
marriage, providing sexuality education, improving 
access to and uptake of contraception, and preventing 
pregnancy resulting from sexual abuse and coercion; 
and (ii) to reduce negative outcomes of pregnancy 
through preventing unsafe abortion and mortality 
and morbidity resulting from it, and improving 
maternal health outcomes by improving access to 
quality maternal health services (24).
The United Nations published an updated edition 
of the International technical guidance on sexuality 
education (31) in 2018 and International technical 
and programmatic guidance on out-of-school 
sexuality education (32) in 2020, and WHO published 
recommendations for Intrapartum care for a positive 
5
1. Introduction
childbirth experience (33) in 2018, an updated edition 
of the evidence-to-action brief on Companion of 
choice during labour and childbirth for improved 
quality of care (34) in 2020, Guidelines for the health 
sector response to child maltreatment (35) in 2019, the 
RESPECT Framework for preventing violence against 
women and girls (36) in 2019 and the Abortion care 
guideline (37) in 2022. As such, the Guideline Steering 
Group decided not to update these sections at this 
time. Thus, the scope of this updated edition of 
the guideline is limited to two sections of the 2011 
edition, namely (i) to prevent child marriage and 
support the needs and rights of married girls, and  
(ii) to improve access to, uptake of, and continued use 
of contraception among adolescents. 
Within these two sections, the population, 
intervention, comparator and outcomes (PICO) 
questions used in this updated edition are similar to 
those used in the 2011 edition; however, the language 
and framing have been updated to reflect the current 
state of the field. In the section on preventing child 
marriage and supporting the needs and rights of 
married girls, the updated edition includes two PICO 
questions that were not included in the 2011 edition: 
one on responding to the health and social needs and 
rights of married girls and another on the meaningful 
engagement of adolescents in efforts intended to 
benefit them. In the section on improving access 
to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception 
among adolescents, the updated edition also 
includes two new PICO questions: one on digital 
health interventions and another on the meaningful 
engagement of adolescents in efforts intended to 
benefit them. Additionally, it includes a PICO question 
that explicitly refers to self-care interventions; the 
2011 edition dealt with related issues but did not use 
this terminology.
Importantly, this updated edition of the WHO guideline 
on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive 
outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-
income countries, as with the 2011 edition, does not 
address the safety and effectiveness of contraceptive 
methods (24). These issues are addressed elsewhere 
(38). It is worth reiterating that there is no medical 
reason to withhold the provision to adolescents of 
any contraceptive method that WHO recommends 
for adults.
1.5 Intended audience of the 
guideline
The intended audience of this updated edition of the 
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and 
poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in 
low- and middle-income countries are the same as 
those of the 2011 edition, namely policy-makers and 
programme managers from governments, NGOs and 
agencies that provide technical and financial support 
to LMICs (24). The recommendations may also be of 
interest to health workers and researchers at global 
and country levels, government officials, professional 
associations, programme managers, and advocacy 
groups. Finally, they are also intended for young 
professionals belonging to the above groups, and for 
young people in general.
1.6 Guideline development 
process
This guideline was developed according to 
WHO standards and requirements for guideline 
development, based on the WHO handbook for 
guideline development, second edition, and with 
the oversight of the WHO Guidelines Review 
Committee (39).
All of the recommendations in this guideline were 
developed by the Guideline Development Group 
(GDG), facilitated by the guideline methodologist 
using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach 
(40). See Annex 3, which describes how the specific 
recommendations and good practice statements 
included in this guideline were determined.
The guideline was updated using a step-by-step 
process, as set out by WHO. First, consultations were 
held with the intended audience of the 2011 edition of 
the guideline to determine whether they believed an 
update would be useful to inform the work they were 
doing. Second, a stock-taking review was conducted 
to determine whether there were publications in the 
public arena to respond to the research questions on 
adolescent contraceptive use. This was not needed 
on child marriage because two major reviews had 
recently been carried out (41, 42). Third, partnerships 
were forged with United Nations Population Fund 
(UNFPA) and United States Agency for International 
6
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
Development (USAID), with which WHO developed 
the 2011 edition of the guideline. Fourth, the groups 
of key contributors to the guideline development 
process were constituted: a Guideline Steering Group, 
a Guideline Development Group (GDG), an External 
Review Group (ERG) comprising small teams from 
one country in each of WHO’s six regions (Argentina 
in the Region of the Americas, Bangladesh in the 
South-East Asia Region, Burkina Faso in the African 
Region, the Republic of Moldova in the European 
Region, the Philippines in the Western Pacific 
Region and Yemen in the Eastern Mediterranean 
Region), and two systematic review teams (one for 
research questions on child marriage and the other 
for research questions on adolescent contraceptive 
use) along with an experienced methodologist. 
Fifth, in consultation with the Guideline Steering 
Group and the GDG as well as other stakeholders, 
the PICO questions were developed in an open and 
consultative manner. Sixth, a series of GDG meetings 
were held – in July 2022 (virtual), March 2023 
(virtual), June 2023 (in person), July 2023 (virtual) 
and August 2023 (virtual) – at which the process 
was set out; respective roles were defined; PICO 
questions were reviewed and finalized; evidence and 
the Evidence-to-Decision tables were presented and 
discussed; and recommendations were formulated. 
Alongside the meetings of the GDG, country-level 
consultations were supported in the six countries 
mentioned above to draw upon the inputs of a wider 
range of stakeholders. Seventh, the updated edition 
of the guideline was drafted and reviewed by the 
GDG, the Guideline Steering Group, and the ERG. 
Eighth, the updated edition of the guideline was 
reviewed and approved by the Guidelines Review 
Committee. Finally, the guideline was published and 
plans to disseminate it and support its application 
were operationalized.
There are two notable changes to the types of 
recommendations included in this guideline. 
First, it contains three good practice statements 
in the section on preventing child marriage and 
supporting the needs and rights of married girls, 
and four good practice statements in the section 
on improving access to, uptake of, and continued 
use of contraception among adolescents. Good 
practice statements may be issued when the quality 
of evidence for an intervention is low or very low, 
but when there is high certainty based on indirect 
evidence and/or expert opinion that the intervention 
does more benefit than harm and when not 
implementing the intervention would be contrary to 
practice norms. In terms of implementation, good 
practice statements should be viewed as equivalent 
to strong recommendations. Second, while the 2011 
edition of the guideline included both action and 
research recommendations, this updated edition does 
not include the latter because separate but linked 
research priority-setting exercises are under way.
1.7 Plans for disseminating and 
supporting the application of the 
guideline
The following approaches will be used to raise 
awareness of and interest in the updated edition 
of the guideline, to build capacity for its use and to 
support countries directly.
First, awareness of and interest in the updated 
edition of the guideline will be built using media, 
including social media, targeted email outreach 
and briefings, articles in peer-reviewed journals 
and newsletters, and conferences and seminars, 
both in person and virtually. Second, capacity will 
be built for the application of the updated edition 
through in-person and virtual seminars that share the 
recommendations, their implications for the field, and 
their basis in research evidence and programmatic 
experience. Alongside this, practical examples of 
their application in different country contexts will 
be shared. Third, direct support to countries will 
be provided through partnerships such as Family 
Planning 2030 and Girls Not Brides.
All of these activities will be conducted in conjunction 
with WHO’s regional and country offices; United 
Nations partners, notably UNFPA, United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 
UN Women, and Joint United Nations Programme on 
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS); and with academic institutions, 
professional associations and NGOs.

1. Introduction
1.8 Overarching evidence gaps
The evidence reviews conducted to inform this 
updated edition of the guideline identified a 
substantial number of research studies and 
evaluations that were published in the 13 years since 
the 2011 edition. However, there are still substantial 
gaps in the evidence either because some issues 
have yet to be addressed or have been addressed 
inadequately, or because of the way in which the 
studies/evaluations have been carried out and 
reported. As a result, the number of studies that could 
be included as part of the GRADE process was limited, 
and the strength of evidence was downgraded in 
some studies. These evidence gaps will feed into the 
separate but linked research priority-setting exercises 
that are under way. Future research studies and 
evaluations should be analyzed and reported in a way 
that enables their findings to be included in future 
GRADE processes.
First, while many studies included young people (i.e. 
ages 15–24 years), few had a large enough sample 
of adolescents (i.e. ages 10–19 years) or else failed 
to disaggregate by age group to permit examining 
effects among adolescents. In particular, few studies 
included very young adolescents (i.e. ages 10–14 
years), limiting the possibility to understand which 
interventions are specifically effective for this age 
group. Future studies that seek to target adolescents, 
including those aged 10–14 years and/or 15–19 years, 
must ensure that the number of participants in those 
age groups is large enough to allow for conclusions 
to be made regarding the effect of interventions 
in that group, and the results must be specifically 
disaggregated by age group.
Second, while it is best practice to undertake multi-
component interventions for adolescents that 
target the multiple influences and influencers on 
their behaviours, assessing intervention effects of a 
specific component is challenging through the GRADE 
process. As a result, the strength of evidence from 
multi-component interventions is often downgraded. 
Studies that seek to understand the specific 
intervention effects of individual components, and/
or those that seek to determine which components 
are the most essential, could test different arms with 
different combinations of intervention components 
and use advanced statistical analyses such as 
structural equation modelling. This would avoid the 
downgrading of the strength of evidence through the 
GRADE approach.
1.9 Plans for updating the 
guideline
Decisions on future updates of the guideline will 
be based on an assessment of their need, through 
consultation with relevant stakeholders. As with 
this updated edition, future updates will follow 
WHO standards and requirements for guideline 
development (39). WHO is moving towards a living 
guideline approach, defined by an optimization of the 
guideline development process to allow individual 
recommendations to be updated as soon as new 
relevant evidence becomes available (43). The pros 
and cons of employing this approach, notably the 
cost and whether there is a need for a rapid update 
to specific recommendations, will be considered in 
making this decision. 
Future guideline updates should consider the 
inclusion of qualitative evidence to inform the 
guideline development process, as is becoming 
increasingly common. The inclusion of qualitative 
evidence such as on the acceptability and feasibility 
of interventions may contribute to improving the 
quality and usability of guidelines, and to ensure the 
needs and perspectives of all stakeholders are taken 
into account. Additionally, the use of other types of 
evidence, including from non-randomized studies 
as well as case studies and programmatic evidence 
should be stepped up, if and where appropriate, and 
in line with the criteria for use of evidence to inform 
recommendations in WHO guidelines.

CHAPTER 2
Guiding principles

2. Guiding principles
This updated edition of the WHO guideline 
on preventing early pregnancy and poor 
reproductive outcomes among adolescents in 
low- and middle-income countries is based on 
the following guiding principles:
 y Adolescence, as one phase in the life course, 
is one of the most rapid formative phases of 
human development.
 y Adolescents have a fundamental right to health. 
Investments in adolescent health and well-being 
bring triple benefits – now, in the future, and in 
the next generation. Such investments also lead to 
substantial economic benefits.
 y Determinants – including both protective and risk 
factors – at the individual, interpersonal, family, 
community, organizational and societal levels, 
powerfully influence adolescent health and well-
being. Determinants may operate at multiple levels 
and in combination to accentuate their effects. 
For example, physical disability, restrictive gender 
attitudes and norms, poverty and insecurity can 
operate together to restrict a girl’s abilities to 
continue schooling. On the other hand, the same 
girl can still attend school if committed parents and 
teachers ensure an enabling environment.
 y Adolescents are a diverse group with differing and 
changing needs, which are often not recognized 
and/or addressed. Leaving no one behind should 
be a key principle in programming for adolescents. 
A concern for equity should be embedded 
within this.
 y Interventions should operate at all levels of 
the socioecological framework. They may be 
adolescent-specific (e.g. comprehensive sexuality 
education), those with wider impacts that need 
to be tailored to the needs of adolescents to be 
effective (e.g. making health services user-centred), 
and those with impacts across the life course 
but with particular benefits to adolescents (e.g. 
improving security). Intervention delivery should 
be of high quality and with universal coverage.
 y Given the multi-dimensional nature of adolescent 
health and well-being, collaboration across 
sectors to deliver multisectoral and/or integrated 
programming is crucial. 
 y While national and subnational priorities should 
guide local action, further contextualization should 
take place locally and should be based on local 
data and insights. 
 y Adolescents should be meaningfully engaged in 
efforts to address their needs, so their expectations 
and perspectives are incorporated into policy and 
programmatic decision-making. There is strong 
consensus that adolescents should be enabled 
to make a meaningful contribution to their own 
health and well-being, and that of others.
 y The rapid physical, mental and social changes 
across the adolescent period make it essential to 
disaggregate data by age and sex.
 y Adolescent health programmes should monitor the 
full range of indicators, from inputs and processes 
to outputs, outcomes and impact. These indicators 
answer different questions and are useful for 
different purposes. Periodic evaluations are 
essential and should build on routinely collected 
monitoring data.

3. Recommendations and  
key considerations
This chapter presents the WHO 
recommendations and good practice 
statements that have been newly developed 
and published for the first time in this 
guideline. 
The recommendations are listed in the Executive 
summary (Table 1) and are described in greater detail 
in sections 3.1 and 3.2. Each recommendation is 
presented in a box along with information about its 
strength and the certainty of the evidence on which 
it is based. This is followed by sections describing 
the background for each recommendation, the 
PICO question(s) and search process, the results of 
the evidence review, the certainty of the evidence, 
and the rationale for the strength and direction of 
the recommendation.
3.1 Preventing child marriage and responding to the needs and rights of 
married girls
Table 3.1 Summary of recommendations and good practice statements
Recommendation 1.1 WHO recommends the implementation of interventions to empower girls 
by building their knowledge, skills, assets and social networks. 
(Conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 1.2 WHO recommends that programmes aiming to reduce child marriage 
and support married girls engage with parents/guardians, boys and men, 
and the broader community to create and sustain a gender-equitable and 
enabling environment. 
(Conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 1.3 WHO recommends offering conditional incentives (conditioned on school 
attendance and/or remaining unmarried) as a broad strategy to increase 
educational attainment and reduce child marriage as a part of social 
protection interventions for girls at highest risk of child marriage.
(Conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
12
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
Recommendation 1.4 WHO recommends the implementation of interventions to remove gender-
related barriers to education and ensure girls’ completion of 12 years of 
quality education.
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 1.5 WHO recommends the implementation of interventions aimed at the 
economic empowerment of girls to improve their financial literacy, 
access to savings, and employment skills and prospects, and to expand 
alternatives to marriage before age 18. 
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 1.6 WHO recommends the formulation and implementation of laws that 
restrict marriage before age 18, consistent with human rights standards.
(Conditional recommendation; very-low-certainty evidence)
Good practice statement 1.1 Political, governmental, religious, traditional and other influential leaders 
should be mobilized to support the prevention of child marriage and 
promotion of girls’ rights.
Good practice statement 1.2 Efforts to address the needs and rights of women and girls should 
recognize and address the specific needs and rights of ever-married girls 
and those in formal or informal unions.
Good practice statement 1.3 Adolescents, including those who are ever married or in formal or informal 
unions, should be meaningfully engaged in the design, implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation of efforts to address their needs and rights.
A three-phased approach was utilized to identify peer-
reviewed journal publications in English to inform the 
development of the updated recommendations on 
preventing child marriage and supporting married 
girls. First, studies included in existing systematic 
reviews related to child marriage were appraised 
for their relevance to the PICO questions. Second, 
a systematic search of additional databases from 
relevant fields was conducted to identify natural 
experiments from legal and/or policy reform. Third, 
a systematic search of additional databases from 
relevant fields was conducted to identify studies 
that consider macro-level drivers of child marriage 
and interventions to address them. This approach 
identified 55 unique references that were ultimately 
included in the GRADE process.

3. Recommendations and key considerations 
3.1.1 Recommendation 1.1
Recommendation 1.1 WHO recommends the implementation of interventions to empower girls 
by building their knowledge, skills, assets and social networks. 
(Conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined the 
effects of interventions aimed at building adolescent 
girls’ protective assets and promoting positive gender 
socialization to prevent child marriage.
WHO defines empowerment as “a process through 
which people gain greater control over decisions and 
actions affecting their health” (44). While a problem 
prevention approach (in this case, a child marriage 
prevention approach) is useful and important, there 
is growing recognition of the need for positive 
youth development approaches (45). Research 
has demonstrated the importance of supporting 
adolescents’ empowerment by providing them with 
opportunities to build their core protective assets, 
which enable them to grow and develop in good 
health, avoid and mitigate poor health outcomes, and 
thrive in other aspects of their lives (46-48). These core 
assets are: 
 y competence (i.e. the abilities and skills to do 
specific tasks) 
 y confidence (i.e. a sense that one can do something 
and have a positive sense of self-worth)
 y connection (i.e. positive bonds with people 
and institutions)
 y character (i.e. a sense of right and wrong and 
respect for standards of right behaviour) and 
 y caring (i.e. a sense of sympathy and empathy 
for others).
Gender socialization is defined as a “process by which 
individuals develop, refine and learn to ‘do’ gender 
through internalizing gender norms and roles as they 
interact with key agents of socialization, such as their 
family, social networks and other social institutions” 
(49). Unequal gender norms are widespread across 
contexts, although they may manifest differently 
(50). As children and adolescents grow and develop 
cognitively, psychologically and socially, they 
consciously and unconsciously absorb and assimilate 
these norms in the form of their own beliefs, attitudes, 
values and practices. 
The 2011 edition of the guideline included a PICO 
question to determine if efforts to inform and 
empower adolescents are effective in delaying 
marriage among girls under age 18. The systematic 
review process at that time did not find any studies 
that met the inclusion criteria. The Guideline 
Development Group (GDG) considered ungraded 
evidence that interventions to inform and empower 
girls, in combination with interventions to influence 
family and community norms, can positively affect 
attitudes and behaviours related to delaying the age 
of marriage. Despite the limitations of the evidence 
at that time, the 2011 GDG made the following strong 
recommendation: implement interventions to inform 
and empower girls, in combination with interventions 
to influence family and community norms, to delay 
the age of marriage among girls under 18 years 
of age.
PICO question
Do interventions to empower girls by building their 
protective assets and/or promoting positive gender 
socialization reduce child marriage? For further 
details on PICO question 1.1 (including comparators 
and secondary outcomes), refer to Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
Seventeen studies from 17 interventions were 
ultimately included in the review for this PICO 
question, of which 11 were randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) and six were quasi-experimental 
studies (QES).
With regard to reductions in child marriage, 11 RCTs 
from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Liberia, Malawi, 
Mali, Nepal, Niger, Uganda, the United Republic 
of Tanzania and Zambia provided low-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of interventions to 
build girls’ protective assets on reductions in child 
marriage. Specifically, three studies found significant 
reductions in child marriage, one multi-country study 
found a significant reduction in child marriage in 
some settings but not in others, and seven did not 
14
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
find significant intervention-attributable effects. 
Three QESs from Bangladesh, Ethiopia and India 
provided very-low-certainty evidence regarding 
the effect of interventions to build girls’ protective 
assets on reductions in child marriage. Specifically, 
two found reductions in child marriage without 
statistical significance, while one found a significant 
reduction in marriage among younger adolescents 
but a significant increase in marriage among 
older adolescents.
Additionally, three RCTs from Bangladesh, Ethiopia 
and Nepal provided very-low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of interventions to promote 
positive gender socialization on reductions in child 
marriage. Specifically, one found a significant 
reduction in child marriage and two did not find 
significant intervention-attributable effects. One 
QES from Bangladesh provided very-low-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of interventions to 
promote positive gender socialization on reductions 
in child marriage. Specifically, it found a non-
significant reduction in child marriage when control 
variables were included to establish comparability of 
treatment and comparison groups.
With regard to improving knowledge about the 
consequences of child marriage and about SRHR, 
five RCTs from India, Malawi, Nepal, Uganda, 
United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia provided 
moderate-certainty evidence regarding the effect of 
interventions to build girls’ knowledge. Specifically, 
three found significant increases in knowledge 
about SRHR, one found mixed results depending 
on the SRHR topic and setting, and one did not find 
significant intervention-attributable effects. Six 
QESs from Bangladesh, Egypt and India provided 
very-low-certainty evidence regarding the effect 
of interventions to build girls’ protective assets. 
Specifically, one showed a significant increase in 
knowledge about child marriage and five found 
significant increases in knowledge about SRHR 
more broadly.
Additionally, one RCT from Nepal provided very-
low-certainty evidence regarding the effect of 
interventions to promote positive gender socialization 
on knowledge about the consequences of child 
marriage and about SRHR. Specifically, it found a 
significant increase in knowledge about SRHR. One 
QES from Bangladesh provided very-low-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of interventions to 
promote positive gender socialization on knowledge 
about the consequences of child marriage and 
about SRHR. Specifically, it did not find significant 
intervention-attributable effects.
With regard to self-esteem and agency, internalized 
gender norms, and supportive social networks, five 
RCTs from India, Malawi, Mali, Nepal, Niger, Uganda, 
United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia provided 
very-low-certainty evidence regarding the effect of 
interventions to build girls’ protective assets. The 
collection of studies was assessed to be of very-
low-certainty for two reasons. First, in the multi-
site studies, significant change was found in some 
sites but not others. Second, three of the studies 
provided insufficient information to determine if the 
treatment and comparison groups were comparable. 
Of the five RCTs, two found significant increases in 
girls’ self-esteem and agency, and three did not find 
significant intervention-attributable effects; one 
found a significant effect on girls’ internalized gender 
norms and three did not find significant intervention-
attributable effects; and one found a significant 
increase in girls’ supportive social networks, while 
one found a significant increase in girls’ supportive 
social networks in some settings but not in others. 
Four QESs from Bangladesh, Egypt and India 
provided very-low-certainty evidence regarding the 
effect of interventions to build girls’ protective assets. 
Specifically, one did not find significant intervention-
attributable effects on self-esteem and agency; one 
found a significant impact on internalized gender 
norms; and two found significant increases in girls’ 
supportive social networks.
Additionally, one RCT from Nepal provided very-
low-certainty evidence regarding the effect 
of interventions to promote positive gender 
socialization on self-esteem, agency and internalized 
gender norms. Specifically, it found a significant 
increase in girls’ self-esteem and agency, but did 
not find a significant intervention-attributable effect 
on girls’ internalized gender norms. One QES from 
Bangladesh provided very-low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of interventions to promote 
positive gender socialization. Specifically, it found 
a significant impact on some internalized gender 
norms, but not on others.
Finally, with regard to harms and/or unintended 
consequences, one RCT from Bangladesh provided 
moderate-certainty evidence regarding the effect 
15
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
of a peer-facilitated empowerment curriculum. 
Specifically, it found a possible indirect but 
significant impact on marital decision-making, 
whereby the intervention incentivized a subset of 
more conservative girls within the community to 
marry significantly earlier. In the study, conservatism 
was assessed using a composite attitude index 
from responses indicating support for restrictive 
gender norms.
Notably, the studies identified for this PICO question 
varied widely in their content, scope, quality of 
intervention design, dose and intensity, and theory 
of change. Overall, the strongest evidence supported 
asset and/or skill-building interventions, as opposed 
to those that promote positive gender socialization.
Certainty of the evidence for 
the recommendation
In summary, the certainty of the available evidence 
ranged from very low to moderate. 
Rationale for the strength and direction of 
the recommendation
The GDG spent considerable time deliberating on the 
strength of this recommendation. It discussed the 
challenge of issuing a recommendation regarding 
interventions to build girls’ protective assets and/or 
promote positive gender socialization due to the large 
differences in the content, quality and conceptual 
underpinnings of the interventions identified in this 
review. Because the evidence on the effectiveness 
of the intervention is mixed depending on these 
differences, and uncertainty persists regarding the 
content and conceptual underpinnings that are 
most effective among different populations, the GDG 
agreed that it would not be appropriate to make a 
strong recommendation or a good practice statement. 
However, based on its assessment that the balance 
of benefits to harms across all outcomes favours the 
intervention, the GDG ultimately reached a consensus 
to make a conditional recommendation in favour of 
this intervention.
Overall, the GDG agreed that the intervention would 
be largely acceptable to girls, their families and 
the broader community, although it may not be 
supported by some who oppose the empowerment 
of women and girls. It agreed that the intervention 
has been demonstrated to be feasible and can be 
implemented with limited human and financial 
resources, if needed. The intervention can also 
contribute to meeting girls’ needs and fulfilling 
their rights, including their right to gender equality, 
and can promote equity if well designed and 
implemented. 
The GDG noted that this conditional recommendation 
represents a departure from the 2011 edition of 
the guideline, which included the following strong 
recommendation: “Implement interventions to inform 
and empower girls, in combination with interventions 
to influence family and community norms, to delay 
the age of marriage among girls under 18 years of 
age” . This change from a strong recommendation 
to a conditional recommendation is primarily due 
to very low certainty regarding the effects of these 
interventions on key outcomes based on currently 
available evidence, including inconsistent effects 
on rates of child marriage, as well as marked 
heterogeneity in the interventions evaluated. The 
GDG discussed the implications of this change for the 
field, given that interventions aimed at empowering 
girls are nearly ubiquitous in multi-component 
programmes to prevent child marriage. It suggested 
that the decision to implement interventions to 
empower girls for the prevention of child marriage 
should be guided by an understanding of the types 
of interventions that hold the most promise of being 
effective, scalable and sustainable and the contexts 
and populations of girls who benefit most from 
such interventions (51). Overall, the evidence review 
and programmatic experience suggested that the 
most promising interventions are those with the 
following attributes: they are girl-centred, engage the 
community as allies and advocates, build valued skills 
as assets that cannot be taken away (e.g. financial 
literacy), create spaces where girls can feel safe and 
supported, and connect girls to services (31, 32, 52).
Finally, the GDG emphasized that the conditionality 
of this recommendation does not imply the 
conditionality of WHO’s recommendations on 
sexuality education. The strong recommendation 
from the 2011 edition of the guideline to “Offer 
interventions that combine curriculum-based 
sexuality education with contraceptive promotion 
to adolescents, in order to reduce pregnancy rates” 
still stands, as do the United Nations’ International 
technical guidance on sexuality education and 
International technical and programmatic guidance on 
out-of-school comprehensive sexuality education 
(31, 32). 
16
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
3.1.2 Recommendation 1.2
Recommendation 1.2 WHO recommends that programmes aiming to reduce child marriage 
and support married girls engage with parents/guardians, boys and men, 
and the broader community to create and sustain a gender-equitable and 
enabling environment. 
(Conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined the 
effects of interventions to (i) build awareness of and 
change attitudes and norms about child marriage, the 
rights of girls, and gender equality among parents/
guardians and the broader community, and (ii) build 
gender-equitable attitudes, norms and behaviours 
among boys and men aimed at preventing child 
marriage. The rationale was that in such a gender-
equitable environment, girls and their families would 
be supported to enable girls to stay in school and to 
avoid early marriage and motherhood.
From research evidence and programmatic 
experience, it is clear that while building personal, 
social, and economic assets in adolescent girls 
is important, this alone is often not sufficient to 
enable them to make decisions for themselves about 
when and with whom to marry. These efforts at the 
individual level must be combined with gender-
synchronized approaches to reach men and boys; and 
to identify and and address influential individuals, 
networks and institutions around them to support 
decisions for girls to not marry (53, 54). Gender-
synchronized approaches are those that operate at 
the “intentional intersection of gender-transformative 
efforts reaching both men and boys and women and 
girls of all sexual orientations and gender identities. 
They engage people in challenging harmful and 
restrictive constructions of masculinity and femininity 
that drive gender-related vulnerabilities and 
inequalities and hinder health and well-being” (55).
In particular, men and boys have a role to play 
as partners in creating such a gender-equitable 
environment to benefit the lives of women and girls, 
and their own. The perceived roles of men and boys 
in gender and development work have shifted over 
time: initially they were invisible; then they were 
seen as promiscuous, violent perpetrators; over 
time, there was growing understanding of them as 
socially constructed within wider contexts of power 
relations and dynamics of masculinities (including as 
victims); and today, there is greater recognition that 
men also have interests in ending gender inequalities 
(e.g. in violence, health) from self-interest to broader 
perspectives based on equality and rights (56, 57).
The 2011 edition of the guideline included a PICO 
question to determine if efforts to influence family 
and community norms concerning marriage were 
effective in delaying marriage among girls under 
age 18. The PICO question did not make a specific 
reference to boys and men. The systematic review 
process at that time did not find any studies that 
met the inclusion criteria. The GDG considered 
ungraded evidence that demonstrated improvements 
in community members’ knowledge and attitudes 
regarding the potential dangers of early marriage 
as a result of community-level and family-level 
interventions, and made the following strong 
recommendation: “Undertake interventions to delay 
the marriage of girls until 18 years of age by influencing 
family and community norms. These interventions 
should be undertaken in conjunction with interventions 
directed at political leaders/planners”.
PICO questions
 y Do interventions to build awareness of and change 
attitudes and norms about child marriage, the 
rights of girls, and gender equality among parents/
guardians of girls and boys and/or the broader 
community reduce child marriage?
 y Do interventions to build gender-equitable 
attitudes, norms and behaviours among boys (as 
peers and/or partners) and/or men (as partners or 
fathers) reduce child marriage?
For further details on PICO questions 1.2a and 1.2b 
(including comparators and secondary outcomes), 
refer to Annex 4.

3. Recommendations and key considerations 
Summary of the evidence
Eight studies from eight interventions were ultimately 
included in the review for these PICO questions, of 
which four were RCTs and four were QESs.
With regard to reductions in child marriage, four 
RCTs from Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Nepal provided 
low-certainty evidence regarding the effect of 
interventions to engage parents/guardians and the 
broader community on reductions in child marriage. 
Specifically, one found a significant reduction in 
child marriage, while the other three did not find 
significant intervention-attributable effects. Two QESs 
from Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, India and the United 
Republic of Tanzania provided low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of interventions to engage 
parents/guardians and the broader community on 
reductions in child marriage. Specifically, one found 
a significant reduction in child marriage in some 
settings but not others, while the other did not find 
significant intervention-attributable effects. One 
QES from India provides very-low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of interventions to engage boys 
and men on reductions in child marriage; it also did 
not find significant intervention-attributable effects.
With regard to knowledge about the consequences of 
child marriage and about SRHR, one QES from India 
provided very-low-certainty evidence regarding the 
effect of interventions to engage parents/guardians 
and the broader community. Specifically, it found 
a significant increase in knowledge about child 
marriage among adults. One QES from India provided 
very-low-certainty evidence regarding the effect of 
interventions to engage boys and men. Specifically, it 
found a significant increase in knowledge about child 
marriage among boys.
With regard to gender-equitable attitudes, behaviours 
and/or norms, two RCTs from Bangladesh and Nepal 
provided low-certainty evidence regarding the effect 
of interventions to engage parents/guardians and 
the broader community. Specifically, one found 
a significant improvement in gender-equitable 
attitudes, behaviours and norms, while the other 
did not find significant intervention-attributable 
effects. Three QESs from Bangladesh, Egypt and 
India provided very-low-certainty evidence regarding 
the effect of interventions to engage parents/
guardians and the broader community, with all three 
finding non-significant improvements in gender 
attitudes. Two QESs from Egypt and India provided 
very-low-certainty evidence regarding the effect of 
interventions to engage boys and men, of which 
one found significant improvements in gender 
attitudes, while the other did not find significant 
intervention-attributable effects.
Notably, no studies assessed the harms and/or 
unintended consequences of such interventions. 
Additionally, very few studies disaggregated the 
results of the interventions by sex, and most studies 
focused on family members and community gate-
keepers, rather than on men and boys in particular. 
Finally, overall, the interventions that utilized social 
norm change strategies—as conceptualized by the 
studies—did not have a significant effect on reducing 
child marriage or improving related outcomes 
for girls.
Certainty of the evidence for 
the recommendation
In summary, the available evidence was of very low to 
low certainty. 
Rationale for the strength and direction of 
the recommendation
The GDG spent considerable time deliberating on the 
strength of this recommendation. They discussed the 
challenge of issuing a recommendation regarding 
the intervention due to the large differences in the 
content, quality and conceptual underpinnings of 
the interventions identified in this review. Because 
the evidence is mixed on the effectiveness of the 
intervention depending on such differences, and 
uncertainty persists regarding the content and 
conceptual underpinnings that are most effective 
among different populations, the GDG agreed 
that it would not be appropriate to make a strong 
recommendation or a good practice statement. 
They also noted that some practitioners consider 
community engagement to be a complementary 
activity to support the implementation of other 
interventions to prevent child marriage, while some 
consider it to be an intervention in its own right. 
Thus, the GDG ultimately reached a consensus to 
make a conditional recommendation in favour of this 
intervention. 
The GDG noted that this conditional recommendation 
represents a departure from the 2011 edition of 
the guideline, which included the following strong 
18
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
recommendation: “Undertake interventions to delay 
marriage of girls until 18 years of age by influencing 
family and community norms. These interventions 
should be undertaken in conjunction with interventions 
directed at political leaders/planners”. This change 
from a strong recommendation to a conditional 
recommendation is primarily due to low to very low 
certainty regarding the effects of these interventions 
on the outcomes discussed above based on the 
currently available evidence, as well as marked 
heterogeneity in the interventions evaluated. 
The GDG discussed the implications this change has 
for the field, given that the intervention is a common 
component of multi-component programmes 
to prevent child marriage. They recommended 
that the decision to implement the intervention 
should be guided by an understanding of the types 
of interventions that hold the most promise and 
the contexts and populations that benefit most 
from such interventions. Specifically, there is a 
need to understand and address the structural 
underpinnings of norms and gender stereotypes 
that interventions seek to shift (58). In some settings, 
such underpinnings might include transactional 
aspects of marriage (e.g. the practice of bride price/
dowry), especially in the context of socioeconomic 
hardship, and how these aspects drive decisions 
about marriage timing. In other settings, such 
underpinnings might include norms and gender 
stereotypes about school-going and women’s entry 
into the workforce. In settings where premarital 
sex and pregnancy are drivers of child marriage, 
changes in norms may be brought about by greater 
acknowledgement of adolescent sexual activity 
(coerced and/or consensual) and better access to SRH 
services to prevent pregnancy. 
Overall, the GDG agreed that the intervention would 
be largely acceptable to parents/guardians, men 
and boys, and the broader community. They agreed 
that the intervention has been demonstrated to be 
feasible and can be implemented with limited human 
and financial resources, if needed. The intervention 
can also contribute to meeting girls’ needs and 
fulfilling their rights, including their right to gender 
equality, and can promote equity if well designed 
and implemented. While no studies examined harms 
and/or unintended consequences, the GDG noted 
one potential harm, which is that the intervention 
could reinforce the authority of individuals other 
than girls themselves regarding marital decision-
making. The GDG also reflected on programmatic 
experience suggesting the potential for backlash to 
such interventions and they, therefore, emphasized 
that strategic and intentional efforts must be made to 
build and sustain support for such interventions. 
3.1.3 Recommendation 1.3
Recommendation 1.3 WHO recommends offering conditional incentives (conditioned on school 
attendance and/or remaining unmarried) as a broad strategy to increase 
educational attainment and reduce child marriage as a part of social 
protection interventions for girls at highest risk of child marriage.
(Conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined 
the effects of conditional financial incentives, 
unconditional financial incentives (labelled or 
otherwise), and non-financial incentives aimed at 
preventing child marriage. Conditional incentives 
are incentives that are given to beneficiaries 
conditional on whether they undertake specific 
actions (e.g. sending their children to school or 
attending regular health visits), while unconditional 
incentives are those that are given to beneficiaries 
without any specific requirements beyond eligibility 
(59, 60). Unconditional incentives can either be 
labelled, wherein their intended impact is clearly 
communicated to beneficiaries, or unlabelled.
In 2022, the World Bank estimated that 712 million 
people lived below the US$2.15 per day poverty 
line (61). Conditional and unconditional financial 
incentives have been widely applied to alleviate 
poverty, including most recently in the context of 
the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic (62). 
19
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
In recent years, there has been growing interest in 
the use of such incentives to prevent child marriage, 
given that poverty is a well recognized driver of child 
marriage across contexts. There is now considerable 
research and programmatic experience in providing 
families with incentives to enrol girls in school, 
to keep them in school, and to ensure that they 
complete their schooling, as a means of contributing 
to several outcomes including preventing child 
marriage (63).
The 2011 edition of the guideline included a PICO 
question to determine if providing economic 
incentives to families is effective in delaying the 
marriage of girls under age 18. The systematic 
review process at that time did not find any evidence 
that met the inclusion criteria. The GDG discussed 
several ungraded studies that collectively indicated 
an improvement in school retention, as well as a 
reduction in early marriage, due to interventions 
that involved economic incentives. However, the 
GDG noted methodological flaws in the evaluation 
designs that limited the attribution of the outcomes 
observed to the interventions implemented. They 
also concluded that there were potential negative 
effects of these interventions. Given this, the GDG 
decided not to make a recommendation for action. 
Instead, they highlighted the need for research in this 
area, as follows: “Undertake research to determine 
the feasibility, effectiveness and long-term impact 
of economic incentives on adolescent girls and their 
families as a means of delaying the age of marriage 
until girls are 18 years of age”.
PICO question
Do the following types of incentives reduce 
child marriage:
 y conditional financial incentives
 y unconditional financial incentives (labelled or 
otherwise) and/or
 y non-financial incentives?
For further details on PICO question 1.3 (including 
populations, comparators and secondary outcomes), 
refer to Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
Thirteen studies from 12 interventions were ultimately 
included in the review for this PICO question, of which 
seven were RCTs, four were QESs, and two were 
observational studies/natural experiments.
With regard to reductions in child marriage, five RCTs 
from Bangladesh, India, Kenya and Malawi (Malawi 
being evaluated both in the short term and long term) 
provided moderate-certainty evidence regarding the 
effect of conditional financial incentives on reductions 
in child marriage. Specifically, four (conditioned on 
staying unmarried or in school) found significant 
reductions in child marriage, while one (conditioned 
on staying in school) found a significant intervention-
attributable effect in the long term but not in the 
short term. Four QESs from Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, 
Mexico and United Republic of Tanzania provided 
moderate-certainty evidence regarding the effect of 
conditional financial incentives on reductions in child 
marriage. Specifically, one (conditioned on staying 
unmarried) found a significant reduction in child 
marriage, one (conditioned on staying unmarried) 
found a significant impact on delaying marriage but 
not on reducing child marriage, one (conditioned 
on staying unmarried) found mixed results across 
intervention arms and settings, and one did not find 
a significant intervention-attributable effect. Two 
observational studies from Bangladesh and Pakistan 
(conditioned on staying unmarried and in school) 
provided very-low-certainty evidence regarding the 
effect of conditional financial incentives on reductions 
in child marriage. Specifically, the study in Pakistan 
found a significant impact on delaying marriage, 
while the study in Bangladesh found a large decline 
in the proportion of girls married as children, but 
statistical significance tests were not presented.
Additionally, four RCTs from Malawi and Zambia 
provided moderate-certainty-evidence regarding 
the effect of unconditional financial incentives on 
reductions in child marriage. Specifically, one found 
a significant reduction in child marriage, while the 
other three did not find significant intervention-
attributable effects. One observational study/natural 
experiment from Pakistan provided very-low-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of unconditional 
financial incentives on reductions in child marriage. 
Specifically, it found a statistically significant 
impact on delaying marriage but not on reducing 
child marriage.
With regard to educational outcomes, five RCTs from 
Bangladesh, Kenya, Liberia and Malawi (conditioned 
on staying unmarried and attending mentoring 
sessions [Liberia]) provided moderate-certainty 
20
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
evidence regarding the effect of conditional financial 
incentives on educational outcomes, with all five 
finding significant improvements. Three QESs 
from Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, India and the United 
Republic of Tanzania provided very-low-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of conditional financial 
incentives on educational outcomes. Specifically, two 
(conditioned on staying unmarried and in school) 
found improvements in educational outcomes, and 
one (conditioned on staying unmarried and in school) 
found mixed results across settings; however, the 
statistical significance tests were not presented. 
Two observational studies from Bangladesh and 
Pakistan (conditioned on school enrolment and 
attendance) provided very-low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of conditional financial incentives 
on educational outcomes, with both finding 
improvements; however, statistical significance tests 
were not presented.
Additionally, two RCTs from Malawi provided 
moderate-certainty evidence regarding the effect of 
unconditional financial incentives on educational 
outcomes. Specifically, both found significant 
improvements in educational outcomes, but the 
improvements were not sustained over time. One 
observational study/natural experiment from 
Bangladesh provided very-low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of unconditional financial 
incentives. Specifically, it found an improvement in 
educational outcomes, but statistical significance 
tests were not presented.
With regard to SRHR outcomes, five RCTs from 
Bangladesh, Kenya, Liberia and Malawi provided 
moderate-certainty evidence regarding the effect 
of conditional financial incentives (conditioned on 
staying unmarried and attending monitoring sessions 
[Liberia]) on SRHR outcomes, with all five finding 
statistically significant improvements. Three QESs 
from Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Mexico and the United 
Republic of Tanzania provided very-low-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of conditional financial 
incentives on SRHR outcomes. Specifically, two 
(conditioned on staying unmarried and in school) 
found statistically significant improvements in 
SRHR outcomes, and one (conditioned on staying 
unmarried and in school) found mixed results across 
settings. One observational study from Pakistan 
(conditioned on school enrolment and attendance) 
provided very-low-certainty evidence regarding the 
effect of conditional financial incentives; specifically, 
it found significant improvements in SRHR outcomes. 
Additionally, four RCTs from Kenya, Malawi and 
Zambia provided high-certainty evidence regarding 
the effect of unconditional financial incentives on 
SRHR outcomes. Specifically, three found significant 
improvements in SRHR outcomes, while the fourth 
found non-significant improvements in SRHR 
outcomes that were not sustained over time.
Of note, some studies involved financial incentives 
as a component of social protection strategies that 
were not explicitly tied to delayed marriage or school 
enrolment. Overall, these results suggested that 
conditional financial incentives may be an effective 
intervention to address poverty as a driver of child 
marriage. 
Certainty of the evidence for 
the recommendation
In summary, the available evidence was of very low to 
high certainty.
Rationale for the strength and direction of 
the recommendation
The GDG made a conditional recommendation in 
favour of this intervention based on the certainty 
of the evidence available and its expert consensus. 
There was considerable debate about the high 
degree of variation in the interventions identified in 
the review: the type, size, timing, scale and funding 
sources of the incentives; whether the incentives were 
conditional or unconditional; and the conditionality 
of the conditional incentives.
Overall, the GDG agreed that the evidence suggested 
conditional incentives are more effective in reducing 
child marriage than unconditional incentives, and 
that conditional incentives should be conditioned on 
girls’ school attendance and/or remaining unmarried. 
The systematic review team for the questions on child 
marriage noted that while six of the included studies 
conditioned incentives on school attendance, three 
conditioned incentives on school attendance and on 
remaining unmarried. It suggested that in settings 
where marriage precludes school attendance, it may 
be reasonable to consider school attendance as a 
proxy for remaining unmarried, particularly because 
enforcement of school attendance may be more 
feasible than enforcement of delayed marriage.
21
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
A few members of the GDG shared programmatic 
experiences that the length of incentive schemes 
and the degree to which participants of the schemes 
could predict future incentives also had an impact 
on their effectiveness (64). Beyond this, however, the 
GDG decided that the evidence was not sufficient 
to recommend other intervention attributes (e.g. 
regarding the type, size, timing, scale and funding 
sources of incentives) at this time.
Overall, the GDG posited that the acceptability of 
financial incentive interventions likely varies by 
stakeholder group: they are likely to be acceptable to 
girls and their families but may be less so to policy-
makers. As such, it noted that decisions about such 
interventions can be political and thus they are 
susceptible to modifications and even suspensions. 
Where financial incentives have been implemented, 
either in the context of a project or a large-scale 
programme, the GDG noted that they have been 
shown to be feasible. However, by definition they 
require the investment of financial resources and 
management capacity. The GDG emphasized that 
financial incentive interventions can contribute to 
promoting equity if well designed and implemented. 
Finally, it cautioned that if they are discontinued, 
there is a risk that early marriage rates may rebound. 
Thus, the GDG emphasized that the scalability and 
sustainability of financial incentive interventions must 
be carefully considered prior to their implementation.
3.1.4 Recommendation 1.4
Recommendation 1.4 WHO recommends the implementation of interventions to remove gender-
related barriers to education and ensure girls’ completion of 12 years of 
quality education.
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined the 
effects of interventions to improve the availability 
and/or quality of educational opportunities on the 
prevention of child marriage. 
While 50 million more girls were enrolled in school 
in 2023 compared with 2015, completion rates of 
lower and upper secondary education, at 79% and 
61%, lag behind the completion rate for primary 
education, which is 89% (65). There is a large 
body of evidence on gender-related barriers to 
education. A recent review set out 18 such barriers: 
lack of support for girls’ education; child marriage 
and adolescent pregnancy; lack of information on 
returns to education and/or alternative roles for 
women; school-related gender-based violence; 
gender-insensitive school environments; lack of 
safe spaces and social connections; lack of teaching 
materials and supplies; insufficient academic 
support; inadequate sports programmes for girls; 
inadequate health and childcare services; inadequate 
life skills; inadequate resources and facilities for 
menstrual health management; lack of water and 
sanitation; inadequate school access; poor policy/
legal environment; inability to afford tuition and 
fees; inability to afford school materials; and lack 
of adequate food (66). The review concluded that 
there is strong evidence of the effectiveness of 
interventions for only three of these barriers: inability 
to afford tuition and fees, lack of adequate food, and 
insufficient academic support. It reported promising 
evidence for the effectiveness of interventions for 
three more: lack of water and sanitation, inadequate 
school access, and inability to afford school materials.
SDG 4 on inclusive, equitable, quality education and 
lifelong learning includes a target aiming to ensure 
that all girls and boys complete 12 years of education 
by 2030. UNESCO stresses that access to education 
must be matched with quality education and sets out 
five dimensions of quality – learners, environments, 
content, processes and outcomes – as well as 
indicators for measuring quality (67). 
The 2011 edition of the guideline included a PICO 
question to determine if expanding the availability of 
education for girls is effective in delaying marriage 
among girls under age 18. The systematic review 
process at that time did not find any evidence that 
met the inclusion criteria. The GDG noted population-
level data and ungraded evidence that demonstrated 
22
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
a positive, protective relationship between the level 
of schooling and age of marriage. The GDG noted that 
methodological flaws, such as lack of randomization, 
lack of control groups and/or lack of baseline data 
limited the ability to attribute outcomes to the 
interventions. However, the GDG decided that there 
were health, social and economic benefits to girls 
enrolling in school, staying in school and completing 
schooling. Based on this, it made the following 
strong recommendation: “Increase educational 
opportunities for girls through formal and non-formal 
channels to delay marriage until 18 years of age” . 
Alongside this, it highlighted the need for research in 
this area, as follows: “Undertake research to assess 
the impact of improved educational availability and 
school enrolment on the age of marriage” .
PICO question
Do interventions to improve the availability and/
or quality of educational opportunities for girls and 
young women reduce child marriage? For further 
details on PICO question 1.4 (including populations 
and secondary outcomes), refer to Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
Seventeen studies from assessments of 28 national 
policy changes and three experimental interventions 
were ultimately included in the review for this PICO 
question, of which four were RCTs, one was a QES and 
12 were observational studies/natural experiments. 
Four RCTs from Kenya, India and Zimbabwe provided 
high-certainty evidence regarding the effect of life 
skills curricula and/or support to stay in school on 
reductions in child marriage. Specifically, two found 
significant reductions in child marriage, and one 
found mixed results across intervention arms. The 
fourth RCT did not find a significant intervention 
effect, although the lack of impact may be related to 
the low prevalence of child marriage in the study’s 
target age group. 
One multi-site QES from Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and 
the United Republic of Tanzania provided very-
low-certainty evidence regarding the effect of the 
provision of school materials on reductions in child 
marriage. Specifically, it found a non-significant 
reduction in child marriage. 
Finally, 12 observational studies/natural experiments 
from Bangladesh, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, 
Cameroon, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Lesotho, 
Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, 
Türkiye, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, 
Zambia and Zimbabwe provided very-low-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of improved availability 
of educational opportunities (through school 
construction, tuition fee elimination, scholarships, 
and stipend programmes) on reductions in child 
marriage. Specifically, seven found significant and 
large reductions in child marriage over time, two 
showed significant but small reductions in child 
marriage, one found mixed results across settings, 
and two did not find significant intervention-
attributable effects. 
Overall, these studies suggest that policies to 
improve access to education and/or remove barriers 
to schooling have a broad positive impact on both 
educational and child marriage outcomes. Several 
studies demonstrated the importance of investing in 
improved access to secondary school or programmes 
that address the transition to secondary school. 
Additionally, evidence supports targeting the most 
marginalized segments of the population to close 
opportunity gaps in access to education.
Notably, no studies assessed the harms and/
or unintended consequences of interventions to 
improve the availability and/or quality of educational 
opportunities aimed at preventing child marriage.
Certainty of the evidence for 
the recommendation
In summary, the available evidence was of very low to 
high certainty. 
Rationale for the strength and direction of 
the recommendation
The GDG made a strong recommendation in favour 
of this intervention based on the certainty of the 
evidence available and their expert consensus. They 
clarified that the specification of 12 years of quality 
education aligns with guidance from UNESCO 
(67). Additionally, while the GDG formulated the 
recommendation to include all adolescents, they 
emphasized that interventions should prioritize 
the most marginalized segments of the population 
to promote equity and more efficiently close 
opportunity gaps. Alongside this, the GDG highlighted 
that girls who have dropped out of school, including 
due to marriage or pregnancy, should be permitted, 
encouraged and supported to re-enter education, 
including alternatives to formal education, where 
23
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
appropriate. Finally, while the recommendation 
focuses on ensuring girls complete 12 years of quality 
education, the GDG recognized that boys also face 
barriers to school performance and completion; thus, 
they emphasized that efforts need to be made to 
ensure all children receive at least 12 years of quality 
education (68).
The GDG noted that the intervention is likely to be 
acceptable to girls, their families and the broader 
community, but there may be reservations from 
some who oppose girls’ and women’s education. 
Additionally, while the intervention has been 
demonstrated to be feasible in some contexts, the 
GDG commented that the intervention may raise 
concerns among policy-makers due to financial and 
human resource implications. Overall, there was 
strong consensus among the GDG members that 
the intervention would promote gender equality 
and promote equity, more generally. Thus, the GDG 
decided that the benefits of the intervention far 
outweigh its potential harms.
3.1.5 Recommendation 1.5
Recommendation 1.5 WHO recommends the implementation of interventions aimed at the 
economic empowerment of girls to improve their financial literacy, 
access to savings, and employment skills and prospects, and to expand 
alternatives to marriage before age 18. 
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined the 
effects of interventions to improve the economic 
empowerment of girls aimed at preventing 
child marriage.
There is growing investment in, research on and 
action for improving the well-being of adolescent girls 
in LMICs. There are several relevant conceptual and 
operational frameworks in the public arena. A recent 
World Bank publication on this subject proposed that 
early marriage, early fertility and low educational 
attainment are tightly linked; and that efforts to 
delay marriage and fertility, and increase educational 
attainment, could contribute to strengthening 
human capital, improving health outcomes for 
adolescent girls and their future children, increasing 
girls’ and women’s empowerment, and reducing 
the risk of violence. It then posited that this could 
break the intergenerational transmission of poverty. 
Concerning the subject of this PICO question – in 
other words, economic empowerment – the World 
Bank publication discussed the evidence on job 
opportunities, information about job opportunities, 
vocational training, life skills building, mentoring and 
empowerment programmes (69).
The 2011 edition of the guideline included a PICO 
question to determine if efforts to inform and 
empower adolescents are effective in delaying 
marriage among girls under age 18. However, 
neither the systematic review process nor the 
GDG’s discussion on this PICO question at that time 
addressed economic empowerment. The 2011 
edition also included a PICO question to determine if 
expanding the availability of livelihood opportunities 
for girls was effective in delaying marriage among 
girls under age 18. The systematic review process 
at that time did not identify any studies that met 
the inclusion criteria. The GDG discussed ungraded 
evidence regarding interventions to improve the 
livelihoods of adolescent girls in relation to delaying 
marriage. While the interventions were effective at 
delaying marriage among girls under 18 years of age, 
the GDG noted weaknesses in study designs, as well 
as challenges in implementing these interventions. 
They also noted that while there were potential 
benefits of such interventions, there were also 
potential harms. Given this, the GDG decided not 
to make a recommendation for action. Instead, it 
highlighted the need for research in the following 
area: “Undertake research on the feasibility of 
interventions to improve the livelihoods of adolescent 
girls as well as their impact on delaying their age of 
marriage”.
24

PICO question
Do the following types of interventions that improve 
the economic empowerment of girls reduce 
child marriage?
 y savings
 y bundled services (70)
 y demand-driven job services
 y childcare services
 y rural electrification
 y land rights
 y microcredit
 y business management training
 y networks and mentors, and/or 
 y integrated services for farming
For further details on PICO question 1.5 (including 
comparators and secondary outcomes), refer to 
Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
Eleven studies from 11 interventions were 
ultimately included in the review for this PICO 
question, including six RCTs, three QESs, and two 
observational studies/natural experiments. For the 
purpose of analysis, interventions were divided into 
the following categories: (i) financial supports and 
services (i.e. girls’ clubs in safe spaces with provision 
of information and resources including savings 
accounts, life skills and livelihood training, and access 
to microfinance); (ii) human capital development (i.e. 
financial literacy and business management training); 
and (iii) social infrastructure (i.e. childcare, networks 
and mentors, job services, and career resources).
With regard to prevention of child marriage, one RCT 
from Zambia provided very-low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of financial supports and services 
interventions on reducing child marriage. Specifically, 
it did not find a significant intervention-attributable 
effect. One QES from Bangladesh provided very-low-
certainty evidence regarding the effect of financial 
supports and services interventions on reducing 
child marriage. Specifically, it found a non-significant 
reduction in child marriage when control variables 
were included to establish comparability of treatment 
and comparison groups. 
Meanwhile, four RCTs from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, 
Liberia and Uganda provided moderate-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of human capital 
development interventions on reducing child 
marriage, all of which found significant reductions in 
child marriage. Four QESs from Bangladesh, Ethiopia 
and India provided very-low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of human capital development 
interventions on reducing child marriage. Specifically, 
two found significant reductions in child marriage, 
one found a significant delay in marriage but not in 
overall reductions in child marriage, and one found a 
non-significant reduction in child marriage. 
Finally, three RCTs from India, Liberia and Zambia 
provided moderate-certainty evidence regarding 
the effect of social infrastructure interventions 
on reducing child marriage, two of which found 
significant reductions in child marriage and one 
of which found a non-significant reduction in child 
marriage. Three QESs from Bangladesh, Ethiopia 
and India provided very-low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of social infrastructure 
interventions on reducing child marriage, all three 
of which found reductions in child marriage with 
inconclusive significance due to concerns regarding 
sample comparability. One observational study/
natural experiment from Bangladesh provided 
very-low-certainty evidence regarding the effect of 
social infrastructure interventions on reducing child 
marriage. Specifically, it found a significant reduction 
in child marriage. 
With regard to girls’ employment, their access to 
and/or control over resources, and/or their economic 
autonomy, three RCTs from India, Uganda and 
Zambia provided moderate-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of interventions to improve 
financial literacy. Specifically, one found a significant 
increase in girls’ economic assets, and three found 
significant increases in girls’ income-generating 
activities and/or paid employment. One observational 
study/natural experiment from Bangladesh provided 
very-low-certainty evidence regarding the effect of 
interventions to expand employment opportunities 
for girls. Specifically, it found a significant increase in 
female labour force participation.
In summary, the strongest quality evidence 
demonstrated that interventions focused on 
improving livelihood skills, including financial 
literacy, had a significant impact on reducing child 
marriage and increasing girls’ employment, access 
to and/or control over resources, and/or economic 
autonomy. 
25
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
Notably, no studies assessed harms and/or 
unintended consequences of interventions to improve 
the economic empowerment of girls.
Certainty of the evidence for 
the recommendation
In summary, the available evidence was of very low to 
moderate certainty. 
Rationale for the strength and direction of 
the recommendation
The GDG made a strong recommendation in favour 
of this intervention based on the certainty of the 
evidence available and their expert consensus. The 
GDG emphasized the importance of both individual-
level and societal-level interventions to improve the 
economic empowerment of girls. Taking contextual 
factors into account, the GDG noted that it may be 
important to complement such interventions with 
gender-synchronized interventions to engage boys 
and men to support girls’ economic empowerment, 
to prevent harms and/or unintended consequences 
(56). Finally, the GDG commented that while the 
GRADE process downgrades the certainty of evidence 
generated from studies that utilize natural experiment 
designs, in the case of this PICO question, such 
studies provided unique insight into the scalability 
and sustainability of the intervention. 
The GDG noted that the intervention is likely to be 
acceptable to girls, their families and the broader 
community, but there may be reservations from some 
opposed to girls’ and women’s employment and 
economic autonomy. Additionally, the intervention 
has been implemented at scale in some settings and 
has been found to be feasible. However, the GDG 
commented that implementing the intervention 
will require financial investment. Overall, there was 
strong consensus among the GDG members that 
the intervention would promote gender equality 
and advance equity, more generally. Thus, the GDG 
decided that the benefits of the intervention far 
outweigh its potential harms. 
3.1.6 Recommendation 1.6
Recommendation 1.6 WHO recommends the formulation and implementation of laws that 
restrict marriage before age 18, consistent with human rights standards.
(Conditional recommendation; very-low-certainty evidence)
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined the 
effects of laws aimed at preventing child marriage. 
International human rights laws and standards are 
clear in their opposition to child marriage. Article 16, 
paragraph 2, of the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) 
provides that “the betrothal and the marriage of 
a child shall have no legal effect” (71). Article 24, 
paragraph 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child (CRC) provides that state parties should “take 
all effective and appropriate measures with a view 
to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the 
health of children” (72).
Both the UNFPA–UNICEF Global Programme to 
End Child Marriage and Girls Not Brides stress the 
importance of having a minimum age of marriage, 
as this legally protects children from abuse, harm, 
violence and exploitation. Laws to address child 
marriage should be part of a comprehensive legal 
and policy framework that addresses its root causes, 
including gender inequality. 
Criminalization is defined as the act of turning an 
activity into a criminal offense by making it illegal. 
In the context of child marriage, criminalization 
involves classifying the action as a criminal offense 
and attaching persecution and sanctions (such 
as jail or a fine). This has been shown to have 
negative consequences for girls, their families and 
communities, in addition to pushing child marriage 
underground (73, 74).
Laws alone, however, are not enough to end child 
marriage. Too often governments use laws to respond 
to social issues without also putting in place the 
comprehensive policies and programmes needed to 
support social change, strengthen systems and make 
them more responsive, and address the drivers of 
the practice. Any implementation of child marriage 
26
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
laws should be based on consultation with civil 
society organizations, put girls’ rights at the centre 
including by acknowledging their evolving capacities 
to make autonomous decisions about their lives, and 
complement and support community-based efforts 
to change social norms and gender stereotypes that 
drive child marriage. 
The 2011 edition of the guideline included a PICO 
question to determine if efforts directed at political 
leaders and/or planners, including those leaders at 
the community level, have resulted in the formulation 
of laws and policies to make marriage for girls 
before age 18 illegal, and another PICO question to 
determine if efforts directed at these stakeholders 
are effective in enforcing laws prohibiting marriage 
for girls before age 18. The systematic review process 
at that time did not identify any studies that met 
the inclusion criteria. The GDG observed that efforts 
to formulate laws and policies, and to enforce and 
monitor them, are unlikely to be addressed by 
intervention studies. The GDG also noted that such 
actions could have both beneficial and harmful 
outcomes. Despite the limited evidence and the 
potential harms, the GDG concluded that ongoing 
efforts are needed to promote laws prohibiting 
marriage before 18 years of age as an important 
measure to fulfil girls’ rights and to prevent early 
pregnancy. The GDG issued the following strong 
recommendation: “Encourage political leaders, 
planners and community leaders to formulate and 
enforce laws and policies to prohibit the marriage of 
girls before 18 years of age”. It also highlighted the 
need for research in this area, as follows: “Undertake 
research to identify effective interventions that result 
in the formulation, enforcement and monitoring of 
laws and policies, including unintended harmful 
consequences”.
PICO question
Does the existence of child marriage prevention laws 
in line with those recommended by international 
treaty bodies, such as the CRC and CEDAW, 
reduce child marriage? For further details on PICO 
question 1.6 (including comparators and secondary 
outcomes), refer to Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
Three studies from 24 national-level policy change 
interventions were ultimately included in the review 
for this PICO question, all of which were observational 
studies/natural experiments. 
All three studies from (i) Benin, Bhutan, Kazakhstan, 
Mauritania, Nepal and Tajikistan, (ii) Ethiopia and 
(iii) Albania, Benin, Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Guinea, Jordan, Kazakhstan, 
Liberia, Madagascar, Maldives, Namibia, Nepal, 
Peru, Sierra Leone and Togo, provided very-low-
certainty evidence regarding the effect of laws on 
the minimum age of marriage on reductions in child 
marriage. Specifically, two found mixed effects across 
population groups, with significant reductions in 
child marriage among adolescents in urban but 
not rural areas in one, and significant reductions in 
child marriage among younger adolescents but not 
older adolescents in the other. The third found mixed 
results across settings and follow-up time points. 
None described or examined the effect of different 
penalties or punishments.
In summary, the evidence review suggested that the 
presence of child marriage laws is not consistently 
associated with a reduction in child marriage and, 
where there are statistically significant effects, 
they are only found for certain subsets of the 
population. Additionally, evidence suggested that 
the introduction of age-at-marriage laws may be 
associated with an initial decline in child marriage, 
but that this impact may not be sustained over time.
Notably, no studies assessed awareness and/
or support for child marriage prevention 
laws, their application, nor their harms and/or 
unintended consequences.
Certainty of the evidence for 
the recommendation
In summary, the available evidence was of very low 
certainty. 
Rationale for the strength and direction of 
the recommendation
The GDG made a conditional recommendation in 
favour of this intervention for two reasons. First, 
they noted that although child marriage laws 
have been widely implemented, the evidence on 
their effectiveness was limited. Second, the GDG 
commented on the absence of data from the evidence 
review on potential harms and/or unintended 
consequences of child marriage prevention laws, 
given programmatic experience suggesting that 
such laws have the potential to push child marriage 
underground and/or criminalize young people’s 
sexuality and/or those involved. 
27
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
The GDG agreed that the implication of the second 
concern is not that child marriage prevention laws 
should not be established, but that their formulation 
and implementation need careful consideration. 
Specifically, they emphasized that laws should be 
formulated according to human rights standards, 
notably those laid out by the CRC and CEDAW, 
among others, with the objective of prevention and 
response rather than punishment. Additionally, 
the GDG members discussed the challenge of 
harmonizing relevant laws and policies, especially 
those regarding the legal age of marriage, consent 
to sexual activity, and consent to receive SRHR 
services, as well as customary and/or traditional 
laws and informal unions. Given this complexity, 
the GDG agreed that efforts to formulate and 
implement child marriage prevention and response 
laws should be placed within a broader context 
of comprehensive legal reform (73, 74). Further, 
the GDG reiterated that legal and policy reform 
should not be implemented on its own, but should 
be complemented with the other interventions 
recommended in the guideline.
Overall, the GDG decided that there is a balance 
of benefits to harms, because laws can be used 
to communicate the position and the rationale of 
governments, can have a powerful signaling effect in 
society, can create the provisions for further policy-
making to address the drivers of child marriage, and 
can lead to the allocation of human and financial 
resources. This is in line with the approach used by 
other WHO guidelines in issuing recommendations 
regarding laws and policies (37, 75).
Finally, the GDG discussed that the limitation of the 
evidence review to English-language literature may 
have resulted in the exclusion of trends in certain 
regions such as Latin America, where informal unions 
among young people are now the norm and where 
specific groups (e.g. Indigenous communities) have 
been stigmatized because of their particular norms 
and practices.
3.1.7 Good practice statement 1.1
Good practice statement 1.1 Political, governmental, religious, traditional and other influential leaders 
should be mobilized to support the prevention of child marriage and 
promotion of girls’ rights.
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined 
the effects of interventions directed at political, 
governmental, religious, and traditional leaders, as 
well as other influential leaders and groups in the 
community on preventing child marriage.
As discussed in relation to Recommendation 2, it 
is clear that while building personal, social and 
economic assets in adolescent girls is important, 
this by itself is often not sufficient to enable them to 
make decisions by and for themselves about when 
and with whom to marry. This may be especially 
relevant in contexts where marriage is considered a 
protective social institution. These individual efforts 
need to be combined with effective approaches to 
identify and address influential individuals, networks 
and institutions around them (53). Research has 
shown that community leaders can hugely influence 
decisions made by families and communities in both 
positive and negative ways (76).
The 2011 edition of the guideline included a PICO 
question to determine if efforts directed at political 
leaders and/or planners, including those at the 
community level, have resulted in the formulation of 
laws and policies to make marriage for girls before 
age 18 illegal. It also included a PICO question to 
determine if efforts directed at these stakeholders 
are effective in enforcing laws prohibiting marriage 
for girls before age 18. The systematic review 
process at that time did not identify any studies that 
addressed these questions. The GDG observed that 
efforts to formulate laws and policies and to enforce 
and monitor their enforcement are unlikely to be 
addressed by intervention studies. The GDG also 
noted that such actions could have both beneficial 
and harmful outcomes. Despite the limited evidence 
and the potential harms, the GDG concluded 
that ongoing efforts are needed to promote laws 
prohibiting marriage before 18 years of age as 
an important measure to fulfil girls’ rights and to 
prevent early pregnancy. The GDG issued a strong 
28
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
recommendation as follows: “Encourage political 
leaders, planners, and community leaders to formulate 
and enforce laws and policies to prohibit the marriage 
of girls before 18 years of age”. It also highlighted the 
need for research, as follows: “Undertake research 
to identify effective interventions that result in the 
formulation, enforcement, and monitoring of laws and 
policies, including unintended harmful consequences”.
PICO question
Do interventions to mobilize political, governmental, 
religious, traditional and/or other leaders reduce child 
marriage? For further details on PICO question 1.7 
(including comparators and secondary outcomes), 
refer to Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
Four studies from three interventions (including 
one multi-country study in three countries) were 
ultimately included in the review for this PICO 
question. As is standard practice using the GRADE 
methodology, interventions that combined 
interventions to mobilize political, governmental, 
religious, traditional, and/or other leaders with other 
interventions were included in the review, but the 
certainty of such evidence was downgraded.
One RCT from Nepal provided very-low-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of community 
sensitization with leaders on reductions in child 
marriage. Specifically, it did not find a significant 
intervention-attributable effect. 
One QES from Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and the United 
Republic of Tanzania provided very-low-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of community 
dialogues with leaders on reductions in child 
marriage. Specifically, it found significant reductions 
in child marriage. Additionally, two observational 
studies/natural experiments from India provided 
very-low-certainty evidence regarding the effect 
of a policy mandating reserved seats for women in 
local government on reductions in child marriage. 
Specifically, the studies found a significant reduction 
in child marriage, increased age at first marriage, and 
a delay in the timing of marriage ceremonies. 
One RCT from Nepal provided very-low-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of community 
sensitization with leaders on increases in 
supportive social norms related to preventing 
child marriage and commitment to taking action 
to prevent child marriage. Specifically, it found a 
significant improvement in supportive social norms. 
Additionally, two observational studies/natural 
experiments from India provided very-low-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of a policy mandating 
reserved seats for women in local government on 
supportive social norms related to the value of 
preventing child marriage and commitment to acting 
to prevent child marriage. Specifically, the studies 
found a statistically significant impact on gender gaps 
in aspirations related to norms on child marriage 
in the years following the enactment of the gender 
quotas policy.
Notably, no studies assessed the harms or unintended 
consequences of mobilizing political, governmental, 
religious, traditional, and/or other leaders to reduce 
child marriage.
Certainty of the evidence for the good 
practice statement
In summary, the available evidence was of very low 
certainty. 
Rationale for the good practice statement
The GDG issued a good practice statement in favour 
of this intervention. The GDG noted that a wide 
range of interventions are implemented in this area, 
targeting different groups of influential leaders and 
using a variety of approaches. However, the GDG also 
noted that there is limited evidence of effectiveness 
of these interventions, which is to be expected 
given the nature of the intervention. Nevertheless, 
they concluded that there was high certainty of the 
potential benefits of this intervention and that it 
had a low likelihood of harms. Additionally, the GDG 
agreed that not including the intervention in efforts 
to prevent child marriage and promote girls’ rights 
would be contrary to practice norms. 
The GDG noted that what constitutes an influential 
leader will vary by context. While common examples 
might include political, religious, and traditional 
leaders, influential leaders could also include 
business or thought leaders, youth influencers, 
athletes, actors, musicians, social media influencers, 
and others. Additionally, taking into account 
contextual factors, the GDG noted that it may be 
especially helpful to mobilize female leaders to 
prevent child marriage and promote girls’ rights. 
Regardless of the type of leader, there is firstly a need 
to understand their individual interests, motivations 
and perspectives as they pertain to child marriage 
29
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
and to engage them in a dialogue with tailored 
messaging, and to try to reach and influence them 
using multiple channels.
However, members of the GDG cautioned that the 
involvement of influential leaders can have harms 
and/or unintended consequences when leaders 
lack knowledge or have misconceptions about the 
harms of child marriage and/or have unsupportive 
attitudes towards its prevention. Therefore, the GDG 
emphasized that implementers should consider 
working to sensitize and secure the support of such 
leaders, rather than to universally engage them or 
involve them. Likewise, it was noted that efforts 
should be made to ensure that such interventions do 
not inadvertently reinforce the power and authority of 
unsupportive leaders, thereby perpetuating gender 
stereotyping and the occurrence of child marriages. 
In such cases where agreement is not possible, a 
difficult but pragmatic choice may need to be made to 
leave them out. 
The GDG noted that based on programmatic 
experience, the intervention is likely to be both 
acceptable to influential leaders and feasible to 
implement. It could be implemented with limited 
resources where necessary. If the intervention is 
effective in mobilizing influential leaders, it has the 
potential to promote gender equality and rights. 
While the GDG noted that some influential leaders 
may not make a positive contribution, there was 
strong consensus among the GDG members that 
the intervention would promote gender equality 
and advance equity, more generally. Thus, the GDG 
decided that the benefits of the intervention far 
outweigh its potential harms.
3.1.8 Good practice statement 1.2
Good practice statement 1.2 Efforts to address the needs and rights of women and girls should 
recognize and address the specific needs and rights of ever-married girls 
and those in formal or informal unions.
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined the 
effects of interventions to improve the health and 
social well-being of married girls.
As noted by UNFPA and UNICEF, “Girls who marry 
before 18 are more likely to experience domestic 
violence and less likely to remain in school. They 
have worse economic and health outcomes than their 
unmarried peers, which are eventually passed down 
to their own children, straining a country’s capacity to 
provide quality health and education services. Child 
brides often become pregnant during adolescence, 
when the risk of complications during pregnancy and 
childbirth increases; these complications continue 
to be the leading cause of death among older 
adolescent girls. The practice can also isolate girls 
from family and friends, taking a heavy toll on their 
mental health” (11, 77). Additionally, married girls are 
more likely to experience rapid repeat pregnancies, 
with increased risks of negative outcomes for 
both mother and child. Two systematic reviews of 
approaches to respond to the health and social needs 
of married girls reached three conclusions  
(78, 79). First, despite awareness of the harmful health 
and social consequences of child marriage, married 
girls and boys remain an overlooked population in 
programming. Second, the limited interventions 
targeting married adolescents are geographically 
concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, 
implemented at a small scale, and focused on SRH 
or maternal health to the neglect of other areas, 
including voice and agency, violence prevention, 
economic livelihoods, schooling, and rights and 
access to legal support. Third, there is a lack of 
programmatic attention to boys and men in the 
context of child marriage responses. Additionally, a 
subsequent landscape review and literature review 
to identify responses to the particular needs of 
young mothers concluded that “despite the fact 
that many pregnancies and deliveries occur among 
adolescents, maternal and newborn health efforts are 
rarely tailored to the needs of adolescents and their 
newborns” (80). This lack of action is matched by the 
lack of evidence on interventions to respond to their 
needs and fulfil their rights (81).
30
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
The 2011 edition of the guideline did not include any 
PICO questions on addressing the needs and rights 
of ever-married girls and girls in formal or informal 
unions. 
PICO question
Do interventions to improve the health and social 
well-being of married girls mitigate the impact of 
child marriage on health and/or social outcomes? 
For further details on PICO question 1.8 (secondary 
outcomes), refer to Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
Six studies from six interventions were ultimately 
included in the review for this PICO question. 
Of note, the majority of the included studies did 
not disaggregate their results by marital status. 
Additionally, there is a large body of literature aimed 
at addressing the health and social well-being of 
married women, some of whom were married before 
the age of 18. However, the search strategy intended 
to identify interventions that were designed to 
specifically address the needs of those married before 
the age of 18. 
With regard to health outcomes, one RCT from 
Bangladesh provided very-low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of interactive group sessions 
and awareness-raising campaigns on the mitigation 
of the impact of child marriage on health outcomes. 
Specifically, it found significant reductions in gender-
based violence and increases in attitudes against 
gender-based violence among married adolescents 
15–19 years of age. Additionally, four QESs from 
Uganda, India, Ethiopia and Niger provided very-low-
certainty evidence regarding the effect of community 
awareness-raising interventions that utilized mass 
media and educational approaches. Specifically, 
two found significant improvements in behaviours 
related to SRHR, two showed significant increases in 
knowledge about SRHR, and two showed significant 
improvements in attitudes about SRHR. 
With regard to social outcomes, one RCT from the 
Islamic Republic of Iran provided low-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of cognitive therapy 
sessions on the mitigation of the impact of child 
marriage on social outcomes. Specifically, it found 
significant improvements in sexual quality of life. 
Additionally, one QES from Uganda provided very-
low-certainty evidence regarding the effect of a 
multi-component mass media intervention in post-
conflict settings. Specifically, it found significant 
improvements in equitable gender roles among older 
and newly married adolescent girls and boys. 
Notably, no studies measured outcomes related to 
the health, education and/or social well-being of 
the children of married girls, nor the harms and/or 
unintended consequences of such interventions.
Certainty of the evidence for the good 
practice statement
In summary, the available evidence was of very low to 
low certainty. 
Rationale for the good practice statement
The GDG issued a good practice statement in favour 
of this intervention. The GDG members agreed 
that the evidence was not sufficient for a strong 
recommendation. However, while efforts to prevent 
child marriage continue, there was unanimous 
consensus among the GDG that there is an urgent 
need for more attention to the needs of girls who 
are married before age 18. While efforts to build the 
evidence base on specific interventions to address 
the long-term and intergenerational consequences 
of child marriage continue, the GDG asserted that 
there is a sufficient level of confidence from an 
equity, rights and non-discrimination perspective 
to support the implementation of interventions 
aimed at addressing these needs. Therefore, the GDG 
agreed that a good practice statement would be most 
appropriate. 
The GDG noted that the intervention is likely to be 
acceptable to girls, their partners and other family 
members and the broader community. There is 
emerging evidence of feasibility. Given that this good 
practice statement calls for existing programmes 
and policies to be made more responsive to this 
group (rather than for separate/dedicated initiatives 
to be designed and implemented), there is likely to 
be limited additional human and financial resource 
requirements. Overall, there was strong consensus 
among the GDG that the intervention would promote 
gender equality and advance equity, more generally.
While there was a desire among the GDG members 
to provide greater specificity regarding the types of 
interventions that should be used to respond to the 
health and social needs and rights of married girls, 
they agreed that it was not possible to do so given the 
available evidence. Thus, the GDG decided to issue a 
31
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
good practice statement regarding the integration of 
the needs and rights of ever-married girls and girls in 
formal or informal unions in interventions aiming to 
address the needs and rights of broader populations 
of girls and women.
Finally, while the evidence largely focused on the 
effects of such interventions on SRHR outcomes, the 
GDG emphasized that married girls have other health 
and social needs, such as those related to mental 
health, that could be addressed by such interventions.
3.1.9 Good practice statement 1.3
Good practice statement 1.3 Adolescents, including those who are ever married or in formal or informal 
unions, should be meaningfully engaged in the design, implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation of efforts to address their needs and rights.
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined the 
effects of meaningful engagement of adolescents in 
the design, implementation and/or monitoring and 
evaluation of programmes aimed at preventing child 
marriage and/or responding to the needs and rights 
of married girls.
Meaningful adolescent engagement is defined 
as an inclusive, intentional, mutually respectful 
partnership between adolescents and adults whereby 
power is shared, respective contributions are 
valued, and adolescents’ ideas, perspectives, skills 
and strengths are integrated into the design and 
delivery of programmes, strategies, policies, funding 
mechanisms, and organizations that affect their 
lives and their communities, countries and the world 
(82). Meaningful adolescent engagement challenges 
practices of exclusion and token engagement, and is 
guided by the following five principles: rights-based; 
transparent and informative; voluntary and free 
from coercion; respectful of young people’s views, 
backgrounds and identities; and safe (82, 83).
The 2011 edition of the guideline did not include any 
PICO questions on the meaningful engagement of 
adolescents in the design, implementation and/or 
monitoring and evaluation of child marriage policies 
or programmes.
PICO question
Does meaningful engagement of adolescents in 
the design, implementation and/or monitoring and 
evaluation of programmes reduce child marriage? 
For further details on PICO question 1.9 (including 
comparators and secondary outcomes), refer to 
Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
Four studies from four interventions were ultimately 
included in the review for this PICO question. Most 
of the interventions described in these studies were 
focused on peer education. As is standard practice 
using the GRADE methodology, interventions that 
combined approaches to meaningfully engage 
adolescents with other interventions were included 
in the review, but the certainty of such evidence 
was downgraded.
Two RCTs from Bangladesh and Nepal provided 
moderate-certainty evidence regarding the effect of 
girl-led movement-building, community activities, 
and social norm change on the reduction of child 
marriage. Specifically, both found non-significant 
reductions in child marriage. A third RCT from 
Bangladesh provided very-low-certainty evidence 
regarding adolescent engagement in a peer 
education programme on the reduction of child 
marriage. Specifically, it also found a non-significant 
reduction in child marriage.
Additionally, one QES from India provided very-low-
certainty evidence regarding the effect of adolescent 
engagement in a peer education programme on the 
reduction of child marriage. Specifically, it did not 
find a significant intervention-attributable effect.
Notably, no studies measured the outcomes 
of community engagement in efforts to 
prevent child marriage, the acceptability and 
appropriateness of programmes, nor harms and/or 
unintended consequences.
32
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
Certainty of the evidence for the good 
practice statement
In summary, the available evidence was of very low to 
moderate certainty. 
Rationale for the good practice statement
The GDG issued a good practice statement in favour 
of this intervention. It agreed that the evidence 
was not sufficient for a strong recommendation. 
However, there was consensus that the interventions 
encompassed by this good practice statement offer 
more benefit than harm, and that not including such 
interventions in efforts to prevent child marriage 
or mitigate its effects among adolescents is outside 
practice norms. Thus, the GDG agreed that a good 
practice statement would be most appropriate.
The GDG noted that the intervention is likely to be 
acceptable to girls, their families and the broader 
community. While meaningful engagement of 
adolescents will require human and financial 
resources, it considered such interventions to be 
feasible in most contexts. Overall, there was strong 
consensus among the GDG that the intervention 
would promote gender equality and advance equity, 
more generally.
There was some debate among the members of 
the GDG about whether the word “engage” was 
sufficiently strong; it ultimately decided to retain 
it given consensus in the field about the term 
“meaningful adolescent engagement” . Additionally, 
of all the implementation stages, the GDG highlighted 
that meaningful engagement of adolescents is 
potentially most critical in the design stage and 
in monitoring and evaluation for accountability 
purposes through a human rights-based approach 
(84). Finally, it was noted that meaningful 
engagement of adolescents requires additional time, 
effort and funding, and that this should be accounted 
for in workplans and budgets and encouraged and 
supported by agencies that provide technical and 
financial support.

3. Recommendations and key considerations 
3.2 Increasing access to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception 
among adolescents
Table 3.2 Summary of recommendations and good practice statements
Recommendation 2.1a WHO recommends the implementation of gender-transformative 
behaviour change interventions with adolescents to strengthen their 
ability to make decisions about their contraceptive use. 
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 2.1b WHO recommends the implementation of interventions to shift gender and 
other social norms to support contraceptive decision-making and access 
to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception among adolescents. 
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 2.2 WHO carried forward the recommendations in the WHO guideline on 
self-care interventions for health and well-being, 2022 revision relevant to 
adolescents’ access to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception (85). 
These recommendations include:
Self-administered injectable contraception should be made available as an 
additional approach to deliver injectable contraception for individuals of 
reproductive age.
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Over-the-counter oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) should be made available 
without a prescription for individuals using OCPs.
(Strong recommendation; very-low-certainty evidence)
Over-the-counter emergency contraceptive pills should be made 
available without a prescription to individuals who wish to use 
emergency contraception.
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
The consistent and correct use of male and female condoms is highly 
effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV; reducing the risk 
of HIV transmission both from men to women and women to men in 
serodiscordant couples; reducing the risk of acquiring other sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs) and associated conditions, including genital 
warts and cervical cancer; and preventing unintended pregnancy.
Provide up to one year’s supply of pills, depending on the woman’s 
preference and anticipated use. Programmes must balance the desirability 
of giving women maximum access to pills with concerns regarding 
contraceptive supply and logistics. The resupply system should be flexible, 
so that the woman can obtain pills easily in the amount and at the time she 
requires them.
34
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
Recommendation 2.3 WHO recommends the implementation of interventions to reduce financial 
barriers related to access to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception 
among adolescents.
(Conditional recommendation; very-low-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 2.4 WHO recommends the implementation of accurate and safe digital health 
interventions for adolescents as part of sexual and reproductive health 
(SRH) programming. 
(Conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)
Good practice statement 2.1 Political, governmental, religious, traditional and other influential leaders 
should be mobilized to support the access to, uptake of, and continued use 
of contraception among adolescents.
Good practice statement 2.2 Interventions to improve the quality of health services should be 
implemented to improve access to, uptake of, and continued use of 
contraception among adolescents.
Good practice statement 2.3 Enabling laws and policies on age, marital status, and consent procedures 
in relation to sexual activity, access to sexual and reproductive health 
(SRH) services and access to specific contraceptive methods, should be 
coherently formulated and implemented to improve access to, uptake of, 
and continued use of contraception among adolescents.
Good practice statement 2.4 Adolescents should be meaningfully engaged in the design, 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of efforts to address their 
contraceptive needs and rights.
A single systematic review of peer-reviewed journal 
publications was conducted in three English-
language databases to inform the development of the 
updated recommendations on increasing access to, 
uptake of, and continued use of contraception among 
adolescents. This was supplemented by a secondary 
search for articles included in other reviews and 
reference lists of included articles. The systematic 
review included 6051 unique references, of which 
216 were retained for the full-text review. Thirty-four 
studies were ultimately included in the overall review.
35
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
3.2.1 Recommendations 2.1a and 2.1b
Recommendation 2.1a WHO recommends the implementation of gender-transformative 
behaviour change interventions with adolescents to strengthen their 
ability to make decisions about their contraceptive use.
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Recommendation 2.1b WHO recommends the implementation of interventions to shift gender and 
other social norms to support contraceptive decision-making and access 
to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception among adolescents.
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined the 
effects of interventions to: (i) empower girls to make 
decisions about their fertility and contraceptive 
use, and to change their perceptions regarding 
the role and status of women; and (ii) shift social 
norms and behaviours regarding adolescent fertility 
and contraceptive decision-making, as well as 
wider social norms such as the role and status of 
women, among parents/guardians, boys (as peers 
or partners), men (as partners or fathers) and/or the 
broader community.
Social norms, including in relation to contraceptive 
use, are defined as: 
“the perceived informal, mostly unwritten, rules 
that define acceptable and appropriate actions 
within a given group or community, thus guiding 
human behaviour. They consist of what we do, 
what we believe others do, and what we believe 
others approve of and expect us to do” (86).
The failure to conform to such norms brings about 
sanctions, ranging from:
“slight displeasure to active or even extreme 
punishment … depending on how important or 
central to social life a norm is, how entrenched 
it is, and what sort of real or perceived harm 
disobedience creates” (87).
Gender norms are a subset of social norms that are 
learned and internalized early in life and that refer to: 
“collective beliefs and expectations within a 
community or society, at a given point in time, 
about what behaviours are appropriate for women 
and girls and men and boys, and the relation and 
interactions between them” (86).
“[Gender norms] sustain a hierarchy of power and 
privilege that typically favours what is considered 
male or masculine over that which is female or 
feminine, reinforcing a systemic inequality that 
undermines the rights of women and girls and 
restricts opportunity for women, men, and gender 
minorities to express their authentic selves” (88).
In particular, men and boys have a role to play as 
partners in creating a gender-equitable environment 
that benefits the lives of women and girls, as well 
as their own. The perceived roles of men and boys 
in gender and development work have shifted over 
time: initially they were invisible; then they were 
seen as promiscuous, violent perpetrators; over 
time, there was growing understanding of them as 
socially constructed within wider contexts of power 
relations and dynamics of masculinities (including as 
victims); and today, there is greater recognition that 
men also have interests in ending gender inequalities 
(e.g. violence, in health) from self-interest to broader 
perspectives based on equality and rights (56).
Finally, gender-transformative behaviour change 
interventions are defined as interventions that seek 
to challenge gender inequality by addressing its root 
causes and transforming harmful gender norms, roles 
and relations through progressive changes in power 
relationships between women and men as a means to 
achieve health for all (89, 90).
The 2011 edition of the guideline included a PICO 
question on interventions related to gender norms 
regarding contraceptive decision-making. However, 
the systematic review process at that time did not 
find evidence that met the inclusion criteria. Thus, the 
2011 edition of the guideline highlighted the need for 
36
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
research in this area, as follows: “Identify feasible and 
effective interventions that aim to involve adolescent 
and adult males in decisions about contraceptive 
use by partners as well as by themselves, including 
interventions that aim to transform gender norms. ”
PICO questions
 y Do interventions to empower girls to make 
decisions about their fertility and contraceptive 
use, and to change their perceptions regarding 
the role and status of women and girls, increase 
adolescents’ new or continued use of a modern 
contraceptive method, their contraceptive method 
of choice and/or dual methods?
 y Do interventions to shift social norms and 
behaviours regarding adolescent fertility and 
contraceptive decision-making, as well as wider 
social norms such as the role and status of women 
and girls, among parents/guardians and/or the 
broader community, increase adolescents’ new or 
continued use of a modern contraceptive method, 
their contraceptive method of choice and/or 
dual methods?
 y Do interventions to shift social norms and 
behaviours regarding adolescent fertility and 
contraceptive decision-making, as well as wider 
social norms such as the role and status of women 
and girls, among boys (as peers and/or partners) 
and/or men (as partners or fathers), increase 
adolescents’ new or continued use of a modern 
contraceptive method, their contraceptive method 
of choice, dual methods and/or male methods? 
For further details on PICO questions 2.1a, 2.1b 
and 2.1c (including populations, comparators and 
secondary outcomes), refer to Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
Nine studies from eight interventions were identified 
in the review for these PICO questions. Of these, 
seven studies from six interventions were ultimately 
included in the analysis, including three RCTs and four 
observational studies/natural experiments. All of the 
studies examined such interventions in the context of 
multi-component interventions, and several sought 
to change norms among multiple groups (e.g. girls, 
parents, communities, and boys and/or men). While 
standard practice with the GRADE methodology 
would be to downgrade the certainty of such 
evidence, the GDG argued that this procedure should 
not apply to such interventions given established 
theoretical underpinnings and consensus in the field 
that multi-component interventions are best practice 
for shifting gender and other social norms. 
Among these studies, three RCTs in Colombia (among 
a general adolescent population), Zambia (among 
adolescents in school) and Niger (among married 
adolescents) provided very-low- to low-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of such interventions 
on new or continued use of a modern contraceptive 
method, adolescents’ contraceptive method of 
choice and/or dual methods. One of the RCTs found a 
significant increase in modern contraceptive use, one 
found a significant increase in modern contraceptive 
use at last sex but did not find significant intervention 
effects for modern contraceptive use in the last 
three months, and one did not find a significant 
intervention effect for consistent condom use.
Some studies additionally examined the effects of 
such interventions on adolescents’ agency, autonomy 
and self-efficacy regarding contraceptive use. 
Specifically, one RCT in Zambia (among adolescents 
in school) provided moderate-certainty evidence 
regarding the absence of a significant intervention-
attributable effect. Additionally, three observational 
studies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(among 10- to 14-year-olds and first-time mothers) 
and Uganda (among unmarried adolescents and 
first-time parents) provided very-low-certainty 
evidence. One showed a significant improvement in 
contraceptive self-efficacy; one showed significant 
reductions in embarrassment to seek contraception 
among out-of-school girls but did not find significant 
intervention effects on embarrassment when 
accessing contraception among in-school girls and 
on embarrassment when accessing condoms; and 
one did not find significant intervention effects in 
contraceptive agency and self-efficacy.
Finally, one observational study in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (among first-time mothers) 
provided very-low-certainty evidence regarding the 
effect of such interventions on supportive norms 
regarding adolescent contraceptive use. Specifically, 
it found significant improvements in two measures of 
supportive social norms, and did not find significant 
intervention-attributable effects on two other 
measures of supportive social norms.
Notably, no studies measured the outcomes of 
adolescents’ access to contraception, reproductive 
coercion or harms and/or unintended consequences. 
37
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
Certainty of the evidence for 
the recommendation
In summary, the available evidence was of very low to 
moderate certainty. 
Rationale for the strength and direction of 
the recommendation
The GDG made two strong recommendations in 
favour of the interventions based on the certainty of 
the evidence available and its expert consensus. Of 
note, it issued only one recommendation in response 
to PICOs 2.1b and 2.1c given their complementary 
focus on gender and other social norms. 
With regard to Recommendation 2.1a, the GDG 
debated whether certain audiences would be 
receptive to the term “gender-transformative” due 
to its potential conflation with gender transition and 
other concerns of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
queer/questioning, intersex or asexual (LGBTQIA+) 
persons. However, it was agreed that the term should 
be retained in the recommendation and defined as 
per the WHO definition: “a gender-transformative 
approach is one that addresses the root causes of 
gender-based health inequities through interventions 
that challenge and redress harmful and unequal 
gender norms, roles, and unequal power relations 
that privilege men over women” (91).
With regard to Recommendation 2.1b, the GDG 
discussed the wide variation in the content, quality 
and conceptual underpinnings of gender and other 
social norm interventions and emphasized the 
need for more research to determine what specific 
interventions and intervention approaches are most 
effective in shifting gender and other social norms. 
Additionally, the GDG noted that measurement of 
norms is still nascent and more work is needed to 
develop and validate measures and methodologies 
for different types of norms in various settings under 
the framework of behaviour change.
The systematic review team for the questions on 
adolescent contraceptive use clarified that the 
studies included in the review aimed to address 
specific gender and other social norms rather than 
broad norms as articulated in the recommendation. 
However, the GDG noted that while there are some 
similarities across different contexts, there are also 
specificities by context. Given this, they concluded 
that the recommendation should use broad 
language. Further, the GDG strongly emphasized 
that such interventions should be tailored to the 
specific gender and other social norms and contexts 
in which they are implemented, and that attention 
be given to the ways that such norms differentially 
impact subgroups of adolescents. The GDG also 
debated whether the recommendation should use 
the terms “shift” , “change” or “address norms”; they 
agreed that the guideline should not be perceived 
as suggesting that change should be imposed and 
opted to use “shift” in alignment with consensus in 
the field (92). Additionally, the GDG debated whether 
to include language about the “role and status of 
women and girls” , as in the PICO questions, but 
preferred to use gender-neutral language to avoid a 
heteropatriarchal framing.
With regard to both recommendations, the GDG noted 
that the interventions are likely to be acceptable 
to girls. Some parents/guardians, men and boys, 
and the broader community may welcome these 
interventions, while others may resist them because 
they feel threatened by girls’ growing agency in 
decision-making and shifts in gender and other 
social norms. Additionally, while the interventions 
have been demonstrated to be feasible in various 
contexts, questions have been raised regarding their 
quality, intensity and duration. Thus, sufficient human 
and financial resources will be required to ensure 
adequate implementation and to reach marginalized 
populations. Overall, there was strong consensus 
among the GDG members that the interventions 
would promote gender equality and advance equity, 
more generally. Thus, the GDG decided that the 
benefits of the interventions outweigh their potential 
harms. 
38
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
3.2.2 Recommendation 2.2
Recommendation 2.2 WHO carried forward the recommendations in the WHO guideline on 
self-care interventions for health and well-being, 2022 revision relevant to 
adolescents’ access to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception (85). 
These recommendations include:
Self-administered injectable contraception should be made available as an 
additional approach to deliver injectable contraception for individuals of 
reproductive age.
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
Over-the-counter oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) should be made available 
without a prescription for individuals using OCPs.
(Strong recommendation; very-low-certainty evidence)
Over-the-counter emergency contraceptive pills should be made 
available without a prescription to individuals who wish to use 
emergency contraception.
(Strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence)
The consistent and correct use of male and female condoms is highly 
effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV; reducing the risk 
of HIV transmission both from men to women and women to men in 
serodiscordant couples; reducing the risk of acquiring other sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs) and associated conditions, including genital 
warts and cervical cancer; and preventing unintended pregnancy.
Provide up to one year’s supply of pills, depending on the woman’s 
preference and anticipated use. Programmes must balance the desirability 
of giving women maximum access to pills with concerns regarding 
contraceptive supply and logistics. The resupply system should be flexible, 
so that the woman can obtain pills easily in the amount and at the time she 
requires them.
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined the 
effects of contraceptive self-care interventions, 
specifically over-the-counter (OTC) availability 
of hormonal contraceptives (including 
emergency contraception [EC]), availability of 
subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone 
acetate (DMPA-SC) and self-injection training, and 
direct-to-consumer contraception.
Self-care is defined as “the ability of individuals, 
families and communities to promote health, prevent 
disease, maintain health, and cope with illness and 
disability with or without the support of a health 
worker” (85). Self-care interventions, in turn, are tools 
that support self-care; these include evidence-based, 
high-quality drugs, devices, diagnostics and/or digital 
interventions that can be provided fully or partially 
outside formal health services and can be used with 
or without the direct supervision of health-care 
personnel (85).
While people around the world have practiced self-
care for centuries, including in relation to fertility, 
childbearing and contraception, its potential for 
increasing self-determination, self-efficacy, autonomy 
and engagement in health for self-carers and 
caregivers, and for mitigating the global shortage of 
health workers, has received increased recognition 
in the last decade (85). The utility of self-care SRH 
39
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
interventions for adolescents, in particular, has been 
emphasized given the stigma, discrimination, lack 
of autonomy, and reprisals they frequently face in 
accessing such services (93).
The 2011 edition of the guideline included a PICO 
question on efforts to make hormonal contraceptive 
methods, including EC, available OTC. However, 
no specific intervention was recommended at that 
time due to insufficient evidence. Thus, the 2011 
edition of the guideline highlighted the need for 
research in this area, as follows: “Undertake research 
to identify feasible and effective interventions to 
improve the availability of over-the-counter hormonal 
contraceptives to adolescents”.
PICO question
Do the following interventions to expand 
opportunities for self-care increase adolescents’ new 
or continued use of a modern contraceptive method 
or their contraceptive method of choice:
 y availability of hormonal contraceptives (including 
EC) OTC (i.e. without prescription)
 y availability of DMPA-SC and training on 
self-injection and/or
 y availability of contraceptives direct to consumer?
For further details on PICO question 2.2 (secondary 
outcomes), refer to Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
No studies in the review met the inclusion criteria for 
this PICO question.
Rationale for the recommendation
While no studies were identified that examined 
these interventions among adolescents and met 
the inclusion criteria, there are existing WHO 
recommendations regarding self-care interventions 
for contraception that are relevant for all individuals 
of reproductive age (i.e. 15–49 years). Thus, the GDG 
decided that the existing WHO recommendations on 
self-care interventions for family planning should be 
carried forward for adolescents (85).
The GDG noted that the primary objective of the WHO 
guideline on self-care interventions for health and well-
being, 2022 revision was to provide evidence-based 
recommendations on key public health self-care 
interventions, including for advancing health, with a 
focus on underserved populations and settings with 
limited capacity and resources in the health system 
(85). The GDG emphasized that adolescents are a 
key underserved population given the considerable 
barriers they face to accessing contraceptive services. 
For example, the GDG noted that the guideline 
explicitly states that OTC EC pills are likely to increase 
access, reduce discrimination and support human 
rights, especially among adolescent girls and 
young women.
The GDG cautioned, though, that the contraceptive 
methods specified in these recommendations may 
not be the methods of choice for all adolescents 
in all contexts. They thus emphasized that self-
care opportunities such as those mentioned in the 
recommendations be complemented with efforts to 
ensure the availability of the full range of modern 
methods of contraception. Alongside this, the 
GDG called for further research on the feasibility, 
acceptability and effectiveness of other self-care 
interventions for contraception, for which there was 
not yet sufficient evidence.
Overall, the GDG noted that the interventions 
are likely to be overwhelmingly acceptable to 
adolescents. Some parents/guardians, partners 
and the broader community may welcome these 
interventions, while others may resist them because 
of prevailing social norms regarding adolescent 
sexuality and childbearing. Some contraceptive 
self-care interventions may be more feasible than 
others, and most will require financial resources 
from providers and, if fees are charged, from 
adolescents. There was strong consensus among the 
GDG members that the interventions would promote 
gender equality and advance equity, more generally. 
Thus, the GDG decided that the benefits of the 
interventions outweigh their potential harms.
40
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
3.2.3 Recommendation 2.3
Recommendation 2.3 WHO recommends the implementation of interventions to reduce financial 
barriers related to access to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception 
among adolescents.
(Conditional recommendation; very-low-certainty evidence)
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined the 
effects of interventions to address financial barriers 
related to access to, uptake of, and continued use of 
contraception among adolescents.
Adolescents typically have fewer financial resources 
than adults; thus the cost of services poses an 
important barrier to adolescent contraceptive use, 
especially in settings where contraception is not 
subsidized or free (94).
The 2011 edition of the guideline included a PICO 
question on efforts to reduce the financial cost of 
contraceptives for adolescents. The systematic 
review at that time identified low-quality evidence, 
mostly from high-income contexts, in support of such 
interventions. The 2011 edition of the guideline thus 
issued the following conditional recommendation: 
“Implement interventions to reduce the financial 
cost of contraceptives to adolescents”. Additionally, 
it highlighted the need for research in this area, 
as follows: “Undertake research on the feasibility, 
sustainability and impact of reducing the financial cost 
of contraceptives specifically to adolescents”.
PICO question
Do the following interventions to address financial 
barriers to contraceptives increase adolescents’ new 
or continued use of a modern contraceptive method 
or their contraceptive method of choice:
 y availability of vouchers
 y free/reduced cost of contraceptives
 y social marketing and/or social franchising and
 y insurance-based programmes?
For further details on PICO question 2.3 (secondary 
outcomes), refer to Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
Four studies from two interventions were identified in 
the review for this PICO question. Three of the studies 
evaluated the effect of vouchers and one evaluated 
the effect of unconditional cash transfers. Broader 
social protection schemes were excluded from 
the analysis, as were interventions that addressed 
financial barriers to condoms alone. As is standard 
practice using the GRADE methodology, studies that 
evaluated interventions to reduce financial barriers 
that were combined with other interventions (e.g. 
health worker trainings) were included in the review, 
but the certainty of such evidence was downgraded.
Two observational studies from Cambodia and 
Nicaragua provided very-low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of vouchers on adolescents’ new 
or continued use of a modern contraceptive method 
or their contraceptive method of choice. Specifically, 
one found a significant increase in the uptake of a 
contraceptive method (type not specified), and the 
other did not find an intervention-attributable effect 
on the use of long-acting reversable contraception.
Additionally, two observational studies from one 
intervention in Nicaragua provided very-low-
certainty evidence regarding the effect of vouchers 
on adolescents’ perceptions of the quality of care. 
Specifically, one found significant improvements in 
satisfaction with the care they received, and the other 
found non-significant improvements in satisfaction. 
Finally, one observational study in Nicaragua 
conducted subgroup analyses with different groups of 
adolescents. It provided very-low-certainty evidence 
that sexually active adolescents who were not already 
pregnant and/or mothers had higher satisfaction 
with vouchers compared to adolescents who were 
not yet sexually active or who were already pregnant 
and/or mothers.
Notably, no studies measured the outcomes of 
adolescents’ access to contraception, nor harms and/
or unintended consequences. 
Certainty of the evidence for 
the recommendation
In summary, the available evidence was of very low 
certainty. 
41
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
Rationale for the strength and direction of 
the recommendation
The GDG made a conditional recommendation in 
favour of this intervention, based on the certainty of 
the evidence available and their expert consensus.
The GDG considered narrowing the scope of the 
recommendation to vouchers, given that most of the 
evidence that met the inclusion criteria for the review 
pertained to this type of intervention. However, 
they agreed that vouchers may not be the most 
appropriate type of financial support in all settings 
and shared programmatic experience suggesting 
other options may be feasible and effective. The GDG 
members also debated whether the recommendation 
should specify “reduce” , “remove” or “address 
financial barriers”; they agreed on the latter, with 
the rationale that “reduce” is not sufficiently strong 
language and “remove” is not feasible in all settings 
(e.g. in the private sector, which adolescents in some 
settings prefer). The GDG considered including the 
term “affordability” in the recommendation, but 
agreed it was redundant, as affordability is a domain 
of accessibility.
Overall, the GDG noted that this intervention is likely 
to be overwhelmingly acceptable to adolescents 
and the broader community. Additionally, they 
noted that the intervention has been implemented 
at scale in some settings and found to be feasible. 
The GDG emphasized that interventions to reduce 
financial barriers should be consistent with the WHO’s 
Global standards for quality health-care services for 
adolescents, and should be implemented alongside 
interventions to address other barriers to adolescent 
contraceptive use and complemented by rigorous 
monitoring and evaluation to expand the evidence 
base (95). While there was no evidence available 
regarding the cost of such interventions, the GDG 
agreed that the cost would depend on the context 
and the specific contraceptive methods involved. 
Regardless, the intervention will require financial 
resources from providers and, if fees are charged, 
from adolescents. Regarding voucher schemes, 
specifically, the GDG discussed some evidence – 
albeit that which did not meet the inclusion criteria 
– suggesting that these schemes are not sustainable 
unless continually funded by governments. Despite 
this, there was strong consensus among the GDG 
members that the intervention would promote 
gender equality and advance equity, more generally. 
Likewise, the GDG members noted that, alongside 
improving access to contraceptive services, such 
interventions also serve to increase demand. Thus, 
the GDG decided that the benefits of the intervention 
outweigh its potential harms in some but not 
all contexts.
3.2.4 Recommendation 2.4
Recommendation 2.4 WHO recommends the implementation of accurate and safe digital health 
interventions for adolescents as part of sexual and reproductive health 
programming. 
(Conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined the 
effects of digital interventions on adolescents’ access 
to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception.
Digital health is defined as the systematic application 
of information and communications technologies, 
computer science, and data to support informed 
decision-making by individuals, the health workforce, 
and health systems, to strengthen resilience to 
disease and improve health and wellness (96). It 
encompasses eHealth, or the use of information and 
communications technology in support of health and 
health-related fields; mHealth, or the use of mobile 
wireless technologies for public health; and emerging 
areas, such as the use of advanced computing 
sciences in big data, genomics and artificial 
intelligence (97).
There is growing consensus that the strategic and 
innovative use of digital health interventions will 
be an essential enabling factor to achieve universal 
health coverage (UHC) and the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development, given their potential to 
overcome geographical inaccessibility of health care 
in under-resourced settings (98). However, the rapid 
42
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
proliferation of digital health has also raised concerns 
regarding the quality of such interventions, their data 
privacy and security capabilities, and diversion of 
resources from alternative, non-digital approaches 
(99). Likewise, its potential for exacerbating inequities 
has also been raised in the context of the digital 
divide, or “the gap between populations and 
regions that have access to modern information and 
communications technology and those that do not 
or have restricted access” (98). Thus, WHO and others 
have called for digital health interventions to be 
developed and implemented in a way that is ethical, 
safe, secure, reliable, equitable and sustainable, 
and that incorporates principles of transparency, 
accessibility, scalability, replicability, interoperability, 
privacy, security and confidentiality (98, 99).
The 2011 edition of the guideline did not included 
a PICO question on digital interventions related to 
increasing use of contraception by adolescents.
PICO question
Do the following digital interventions for clients 
increase adolescents’ new or continued use of a 
modern contraceptive method or their contraceptive 
method choice:
 y targeted and untargeted communication 
to persons
 y person-to-person communication and
 y on-demand communication with persons?
For further details on PICO question 2.4 (comparators 
and secondary outcomes), refer to Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
Seven studies from six interventions were identified 
in the review for this PICO question. Of these, four 
studies from four interventions were ultimately 
included in the analysis, including three RCTs and one 
observational study. Three of the studies evaluated 
the effect of on-demand communication with 
persons, and two evaluated the effect of targeted 
communication to persons; no studies evaluated the 
effect of person-to-person communication nor digital 
contraceptive counselling interventions.
One RCT in Tajikistan provided very-low-certainty 
evidence regarding the effect of digital interventions 
on adolescents’ new or continued use of a modern 
contraceptive method or their contraceptive method 
of choice. Specifically, it showed a non-significant 
increase in contraceptive use.
Three RCTs in Tajikistan, Peru and Kenya provided 
very-low- to moderate-certainty evidence regarding 
the effect of digital interventions on adolescents’ 
correct knowledge about contraception methods, 
their side-effects, return to fertility, and sources of 
contraception. Specifically, one of these studies found 
a significant reduction in myths and misconceptions, 
and two found non-significant increases 
in knowledge.
One RCT in Tajikistan provided very-low- to low-
certainty evidence regarding the effect of digital 
interventions on adolescents’ agency to negotiate 
with their partner, obtain contraception and manage 
side-effects. Specifically, it did not show a significant 
intervention-attributable effect. Additionally, one 
observational study in Kenya and Brazil provided 
very-low-certainty evidence in this area. Specifically, 
it showed an increase in adolescents’ agency, but 
statistical significance tests were not presented.
Notably, no studies measured the outcome of harms 
and/or unintended consequences.
Certainty of the evidence for 
the recommendation
In summary, the available evidence was of very low to 
moderate certainty.
Rationale for the strength and direction of 
the recommendation
The GDG made a conditional recommendation in 
favour of this intervention for two reasons. First, 
GDG members noted that the available evidence 
was limited. In particular, they raised concerns 
regarding the absence of data on harms and/or 
unintended consequences of digital interventions 
given programmatic experience suggesting that such 
interventions can be susceptible to misinformation 
and bias (especially in the context of artificial 
intelligence), and raised issues regarding data 
protection, privacy and safety. Second, they agreed 
that a strong recommendation or good practice 
statement would be inappropriate given equity 
considerations in the context of the digital divide. The 
GDG highlighted programmatic experiences from the 
COVID-19 pandemic, in which digital interventions 
were beneficial in some contexts and for some 
populations, but not for others.
Despite these concerns, the GDG agreed that 
digital interventions, when complemented with 
other intervention approaches, present a new and 
43
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
promising opportunity to improve access to, uptake 
of, and continued use of contraception among 
adolescents. Finally, in making its decision the 
GDG acknowledged the following existing WHO 
recommendation applies to adolescents: “WHO 
recommends digital targeted client communication 
for behaviour change regarding sexual, reproductive, 
maternal, newborn and child health, under the 
condition that concerns about sensitive content and 
data privacy are adequately addressed” (97).
Overall, the GDG noted that the intervention is likely 
to be acceptable to adolescents, their families and 
the broader community, although some may have 
concerns, such as those regarding safety, data 
privacy and security. The GDG agreed that digital 
interventions are likely to be feasible in a growing 
number of settings, and that while upfront costs will 
be required for the design and development of the 
interventions, ongoing resource requirements are 
likely to be modest. Finally, while the intervention 
has the potential to increase access to contraceptive 
information and services for those adolescents with 
access to digital technology, the GDG emphasized 
that it could exacerbate gender and other inequities 
in the context of the digital divide. As such, the GDG 
endorsed the principle of improving digital literacy 
as part of wider efforts to improve health literacy, 
as exemplified by its inclusion in the 2018 update 
of the International Technical Guidance on Sexuality 
Education (31). Thus, they decided that the benefits 
of the intervention outweigh the potential harms for 
some but not all adolescents.
3.2.5 Good practice statement 2.1
Good practice statement 2.1 Political, governmental, religious, traditional and other influential leaders 
should be mobilized to support the access to, uptake of, and continued use 
of contraception among adolescents.
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined 
the effects of interventions directed at political, 
governmental, religious and traditional leaders, as 
well as other influential leaders and groups in the 
community on adolescents’ access to, uptake of, and 
continued use of contraception.
Political, governmental, religious and traditional 
leaders, as well as other influential leaders and 
groups in the community, play a critical role in 
shaping an enabling or restrictive environment 
for adolescents to access and use contraception, 
through their influence on formalized rules, informal 
regulations and community norms.
The 2011 edition of the guideline included a PICO 
question on efforts directed at community members 
and leaders to increase access to contraceptives 
for adolescents. The systematic review process 
at that time did not find any studies that met 
the inclusion criteria. However, the 2011 edition 
issued the following strong recommendation on 
the basis of expert opinion, notably focused on 
community members rather than leaders: “Undertake 
interventions to influence community members to 
support access to contraceptives for adolescents”. 
Additionally, it highlighted the need for research in 
this area, as follows: “Undertake research to identify 
and evaluate interventions that influence community 
members’ support for access to contraceptives for 
adolescents”.
PICO question
Do interventions directed at political, governmental, 
religious and traditional leaders, as well as other 
influential leaders and groups in the community, 
increase adolescents’ new or continued use of a 
modern contraceptive method, their contraceptive 
method of choice and/or dual methods? For further 
details on PICO question 2.5 (secondary outcomes), 
refer to Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
Seven studies from seven interventions were 
identified in the review for this PICO question. 
However, all seven studies were multi-component and 
only met the inclusion criteria when applied broadly. 
Likewise, the information about the interventions 
directed at leaders was limited. Given this, the ability 
to ascertain the impact of the interventions directed 
at political, governmental, religious and traditional 
leaders on the outcomes of interest is also limited.

Certainty of the evidence for the good 
practice statement
In summary, there was no available evidence 
that could be used to directly inform 
this recommendation.
Rationale for the good practice statement
The GDG issued a good practice statement in favour 
of this intervention. While the evidence on this topic 
continues to be limited, the GDG had high certainty 
regarding the importance of this intervention. There 
was consensus that the intervention does more 
benefit than harm, and that not including it in efforts 
to increase access to, uptake of, and continued use of 
contraception among adolescents would be contrary 
to practice norms.
The GDG emphasized that this good practice 
statement should not be seen as a downgrade from 
the 2011 edition of the guideline, in which there was 
the following strong recommendation: “Undertake 
interventions to influence community members to 
support access to contraceptives for adolescents”. 
This change from a strong recommendation to 
a good practice statement is primarily due to 
very low certainty regarding the effects of these 
interventions on the outcomes of interest based on 
the currently available evidence. With this in mind, 
the GDG reiterated WHO’s assertion that, in terms of 
implementation, good practice statements should be 
viewed as equivalent to strong recommendations.
The GDG noted that what constitutes an “influential 
leader” will vary by context. While common examples 
might include political, governmental, religious 
and traditional leaders, influential leaders could 
also include business or thought leaders, youth 
influencers, athletes, actors, musicians, social media 
influencers and others. Regardless of the type of 
leader, there is primarily a need to understand their 
individual interests, motivations and perspectives 
as they pertain to adolescent contraceptive use to 
reach them with tailored messages through multiple 
channels, and to engage them in dialogue.
However, members of the GDG cautioned that the 
involvement of influential leaders can result in 
harms and/or unintended consequences when such 
leaders have misconceptions about adolescent 
contraceptive use and related issues and/or have 
unsupportive attitudes towards it. Therefore, the 
GDG emphasized that efforts should be made to 
sensitize and increase support from such leaders, 
rather than to universally engage or involve them. 
Likewise, it was noted that efforts should be made to 
ensure that such interventions do not inadvertently 
reinforce the power and authority of unsupportive 
leaders, thereby perpetuating and reinforcing barriers 
to contraception. In cases where agreement is not 
possible, a difficult but pragmatic choice may need to 
be made to leave them out.
The GDG noted that, based on programmatic 
experience, the intervention is likely to be both 
acceptable to influential leaders and feasible to 
implement. It could be implemented with limited 
resources where necessary. While the GDG noted that 
some influential leaders may not make a positive 
contribution, there was strong consensus that the 
intervention would promote gender equality and 
advance equity, more generally. Thus, the GDG 
decided that the benefits of the intervention far 
outweigh its potential harms.
3.2.6 Good practice statement 2.2
Good practice statement 2.2 Interventions to improve the quality of health services should be 
implemented to improve access to, uptake of, and continued use of 
contraception among adolescents.
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined the 
effects of interventions to improve the quality of 
contraceptive services on adolescents’ access to, 
uptake of, and continued use of contraception.
The delivery of high-quality health-care services 
has long been recognized as a central goal of health 
systems worldwide. However, evidence from high-, 
middle- and low-income countries alike shows that 
services for adolescents are highly fragmented, poorly 
45
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
coordinated and uneven in quality (95). In 2012, 
WHO defined adolescent-friendly health services 
as those that are accessible, acceptable, equitable, 
appropriate and effective (100). In 2014, WHO issued 
guidance on ensuring human rights in the provision 
of contraceptive information and services, including 
for adolescents, by delivering such information and 
services in a way that ensures fully informed decision-
making, respects dignity, autonomy, privacy and 
confidentiality, and is sensitive to individuals’ needs 
and perspectives (101). In 2015, WHO also published 
global standards for high-quality health services 
for adolescents, namely related to adolescents’ 
health literacy, community support, appropriate 
packages of services, provider competencies, facility 
characteristics, equity and non-discrimination, 
data and quality improvement, and adolescents’ 
participation (95).
The 2011 edition of the guideline included a PICO 
question on efforts to improve health services 
to increase adolescents’ access to contraceptive 
information and services. On the basis of a number 
of graded studies and expert opinion, the 2011 
edition of the guideline issued the following strong 
recommendation: “Implement interventions to 
improve health service delivery to adolescents as 
a means of facilitating their access to and use of 
contraceptive information and services”.
PICO question
Do interventions to improve the following aspects 
of quality of services (drawn from WHO’s Global 
standards for quality health-care services for 
adolescents (95)) increase adolescents’ new or 
continued use of a modern contraceptive method or 
their contraceptive method of choice:
 y appropriate package of services
 y provider competencies and lack of bias
 y facility characteristics
 y equity and non-discrimination and
 y data and quality improvement?
For further details on PICO question 2.6 (secondary 
outcomes), refer to Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
Eight studies from eight interventions were identified 
in the review for this PICO question. Two studies 
evaluated the effect of interventions to address 
appropriate packages of services, four evaluated 
the effect of interventions to address provider 
competencies and bias, one evaluated the effect 
of interventions to address facility characteristics, 
and one evaluated the effect of interventions to 
address data and quality improvement. No studies 
evaluated the effect of interventions on equity 
and non-discrimination.
Most of these studies examined the effects of such 
interventions on adolescents’ uptake of and/or 
continued use of a modern contraceptive method or 
their contraceptive method of choice. With regard to 
appropriate packages of services, one observational 
study in Ethiopia (among unmarried adolescents) 
provided very-low-certainty evidence regarding 
the effect of interventions to address appropriate 
packages of services; specifically, it did not find 
a significant intervention-attributable effect on 
contraceptive use.
With regard to provider competencies and bias, one 
RCT in Burkina Faso, Pakistan and the United Republic 
of Tanzania provided moderate-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of interventions to address 
provider competencies and bias; specifically, it 
showed a significant increase in contraceptive use in 
one country, a non-significant increase in the second 
country, and no significant intervention-attributable 
effect in the third country. One observational study 
in Malawi provided very-low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of interventions to address 
provider competencies and bias; specifically, 
it showed an increase in contraceptive use but 
statistical significance tests were not presented. 
Subgroup analysis from one observational study in 
Uganda also provided very-low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of interventions to address 
provider competencies and bias; specifically, it 
showed an increase in contraceptive use among 
older adolescents (15–19 years) but not for younger 
adolescents (10–14 years), but, again, statistical 
significance tests were not presented.
With regard to facility characteristics, one 
observational study in Kenya provided very-
low-certainty evidence regarding the effect of 
interventions to address facility characteristics; 
specifically, it showed an increase in the number of 
services delivered to adolescent clients, but statistical 
significance tests were not presented.
46
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
Finally, with regard to data and quality 
improvement, one non-randomized trial in 
Kenya provided very-low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of interventions to address 
data and quality improvement, specifically using 
community scorecards; it did not find a significant 
intervention-attributable effect.
Two studies also examined the effect of such 
interventions on adolescents’ perceptions regarding 
the quality of care. With regard to appropriate 
packages of services, one observational study in 
India provided very-low-certainty evidence regarding 
the effect of interventions to address appropriate 
packages of services; specifically, it showed an 
improvement in perceived quality of care, but 
statistical significance tests were not presented. 
Additionally, with regard to provider competencies 
and bias, one observational study in Bangladesh 
provided very-low-certainty evidence regarding 
the effect of interventions to address provider 
competencies and bias; specifically, it showed 
significant improvements in quality of care. 
Notably, no studies measured the outcome of 
adolescents’ access to contraception, nor harms and/
or unintended consequences. 
Certainty of the evidence for the good 
practice statement
In summary, the available evidence was of very low to 
moderate certainty. 
Rationale for the good practice statement
There was substantial debate among the GDG 
members about whether this recommendation 
should be a good practice statement or a strong 
recommendation. While many members expressed 
a preference for it to be a strong recommendation, 
the GDG agreed that the evidence was not sufficient. 
However, there was consensus that the interventions 
encompassed by this good practice statement do 
more good than harm, and that not including such 
interventions in efforts to increase contraceptive use 
among adolescents would be contrary to practice 
norms. Thus, the GDG agreed that a good practice 
statement would be most appropriate.
The GDG emphasized that this good practice 
statement should not be seen as a downgrade from 
the 2011 edition of the guideline, in which there was 
the following strong recommendation: “Implement 
interventions to improve health service delivery to 
adolescents as a means of facilitating their access to 
and use of contraceptive information and services”.  
This change from a strong recommendation to a good 
practice statement is primarily due to the very low 
to moderate certainty regarding the effects of these 
interventions on the outcomes of interest based on 
the currently available evidence. With this in mind, 
the GDG reiterated WHO’s assertion that, in terms of 
implementation, good practice statements should be 
viewed as equivalent to strong recommendations (39).
Overall, the GDG noted that the intervention is 
likely to be acceptable to adolescents, their families 
and the broader community, although those who 
do not support adolescent contraceptive use may 
be opposed to it. While improving the quality of 
health services will require human and financial 
resources, the GDG emphasized that a growing 
number of countries have a history of implementing 
interventions to improve the quality of health 
services for adolescents generally, and in relation 
to contraceptive use. Thus, they considered the 
intervention to be feasible in most contexts. 
Importantly, the GDG highlighted the relevance of 
this good practice statement for both the public and 
private health sectors, given that the private sector 
is an important source of contraception for many 
adolescents (102). Finally, there was strong consensus 
among the GDG members that the intervention 
would promote gender equality and advance equity, 
more generally.
47
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
3.2.7 Good practice statement 2.3
Good practice statement 2.3 Enabling laws and policies on age, marital status and consent procedures 
in relation to sexual activity, access to sexual and reproductive health 
services and access to specific contraceptive methods, should be 
coherently formulated and implemented to improve access to, uptake of, 
and continued use of contraception among adolescents.
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined the 
effects of enabling laws and policies on age, marital 
status and consent procedures on adolescents’ access 
to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception.
States are obliged under human rights law to adopt 
legal and policy measures to ensure access of all 
individuals, including adolescents, to affordable, 
safe and effective contraceptives (103). However, 
many countries continue to restrict adolescents’ 
access to contraceptive services on the basis of age 
and/or marital status (104). Likewise, contradictory 
laws and policies and legal exceptions related to 
adolescent contraceptive use, as well as adolescent 
sexual activity more generally, create confusion and 
dissuade adolescents from seeking contraception and 
health workers from providing it (105).
The 2011 edition of the guideline included two PICO 
questions on the formulation of laws and policies 
to increase access to contraceptive information and 
services and EC for adolescents. The systematic 
review process at that time did not find studies 
that met the inclusion criteria. However, the 2011 
edition of the guideline issued the following strong 
recommendation on the basis of human rights and 
expert opinion: “Undertake efforts with political 
leaders and planners to formulate laws and policies 
to increase adolescent access to contraceptive 
information and services, including emergency 
contraceptives”. Additionally, it highlighted the 
need for research in this area, as follows: “Undertake 
research to identify feasible and effective interventions 
that result in the formulation of such laws and 
policies”.
PICO question
Does the existence and/or proper application and 
implementation of enabling laws and policies on the 
following issues related to sexual activity, access to 
SRH services, and access to specific contraceptive 
methods, increase adolescents’ uptake of and/or 
continued use of a modern contraceptive method or 
their contraceptive method of choice:
 y age
 y marital status and
 y consent procedures?
For further details on PICO question 2.7 (including 
populations and secondary outcomes), refer to 
Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
One study from one intervention was identified in 
the review for this PICO question. This observational 
study in Ethiopia provided low-certainty evidence 
regarding the effect of such laws and policies on 
adolescents’ uptake of and/or continued use of a 
modern contraceptive method or their contraceptive 
method of choice. Specifically, it showed an increase 
in contraceptive use and postpartum contraceptive 
use among married adolescents, but statistical 
significance tests were not presented.
Notably, no studies measured the outcomes 
of adolescents’ access to contraception, their 
agency and/or autonomy to make decisions 
about contraceptive use, or harms and/or 
unintended consequences.
Certainty of the evidence for the good 
practice statement
In summary, the available evidence was of 
low certainty.
Rationale for the good practice statement
The GDG issued a good practice statement in favour 
of this intervention. They agreed that the evidence 
was not sufficient for a strong recommendation. 
However, there was consensus that the intervention 
encompassed by this good practice statement does 
more good than harm, and that not including the 
intervention in efforts to increase contraceptive use 
among adolescents would be contrary to practice 
norms. Thus, the GDG agreed that a good practice 
48
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
statement would be most appropriate. This is in line 
with the approach used by other WHO guidelines in 
issuing recommendations regarding laws and policies 
(37, 75).
The GDG emphasized that this good practice 
statement should not be seen as a downgrade from 
the 2011 edition of the guideline, in which there was 
the following strong recommendation: “Undertake 
efforts with political leaders and planners to formulate 
laws and policies to increase adolescent access to 
contraceptive information and services, including 
emergency contraceptives”. This change from a strong 
recommendation to a good practice statement is 
primarily due to the low certainty regarding the 
effects of these interventions on the outcomes of 
interest based on the currently available evidence. 
With this in mind, the GDG reiterated WHO’s assertion 
that, in terms of implementation, good practice 
statements should be viewed as equivalent to 
strong recommendations.
The GDG noted the absence of data from the evidence 
review on potential harms and/or unintended 
consequences of such laws and policies, given 
programmatic experiences of harms in contexts 
where there are discrepancies between laws and 
policies and/or where they penalize adolescents 
who engage in sexual activity or seek contraceptive 
services before a particular age or outside the context 
of marriage. The GDG members agreed that the 
implication of these concerns is not that such laws 
and policies should not be established, but that the 
way they are formulated and implemented needs 
careful consideration. Specifically, they discussed that 
laws and policies should be formulated according to 
human rights standards, notably those laid out by 
the CRC and CEDAW, with the objective of assuring 
health and well-being rather than punishment. 
Likewise, the GDG emphasized that legal and policy 
reform should not be implemented on its own, but 
should be complemented with the other interventions 
recommended in this guideline.
Overall, the GDG agreed that the intervention is likely 
to be acceptable to adolescents, their families and 
the broader community, although those who do 
not support adolescent contraceptive use may be 
opposed to it. Enabling laws and policies on these 
issues have been formulated and implemented in 
many countries, demonstrating their feasibility. 
Finally, there was strong consensus among the GDG 
that the intervention would promote gender equality 
and advance equity, more generally.
3.2.8 Good practice statement 2.4
Good practice statement 2.4 Adolescents should be meaningfully engaged in the design, 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of efforts to address their 
contraceptive needs and rights.
Background
The WHO Guideline Steering Group examined the 
effects of meaningful engagement of adolescents 
in the design, implementation and/or monitoring 
and evaluation of programmes aimed at increasing 
adolescents’ access to, uptake of, and continued use 
of contraception.
Meaningful adolescent engagement is defined as an 
inclusive, intentional, mutually-respectful partnership 
between adolescents and adults whereby power 
is shared, respective contributions are valued, and 
adolescents’ ideas, perspectives, skills and strengths 
are integrated into the design
and delivery of programmes, strategies, policies, 
funding mechanisms and organizations that affect 
their lives and their communities, countries and 
the world (82). It challenges practices of exclusion 
and token engagement, and is guided by the 
following five principles: rights-based; transparent 
and informative; voluntary and free from coercion; 
respectful of young people’s views, backgrounds and 
identities; and safe (82, 83).
The 2011 edition of the guideline did not include a 
PICO question on the meaningful engagement of 
adolescents in the design, implementation and/or 
monitoring and evaluation of contraceptive services 
or programmes.
49
3. Recommendations and key considerations 
PICO question
Does meaningful engagement of adolescents in 
the design, implementation and/or monitoring and 
evaluation of programmes increase adolescents’ 
uptake of and/or continued use of a modern 
contraceptive method and/or their contraceptive 
method of choice? For further details on PICO 
question 2.8 (including comparators and secondary 
outcomes), refer to Annex 4.
Summary of the evidence
No studies were identified in the review for this PICO 
question, as no studies compared interventions 
with meaningful engagement of adolescents to 
interventions without meaningful engagement. 
Some studies from other PICO questions included 
meaningful engagement of adolescents as part of 
multi-component intervention strategies, compared 
with no intervention. However, the information 
about what was done to engage adolescents was 
limited. Given this, the ability to ascertain the impact 
of the intervention on the outcomes of interest is 
also limited.
Certainty of the evidence for the good 
practice statement
In summary, there was no available evidence to 
directly inform this recommendation. 
Rationale for the good practice statement
The GDG issued a good practice statement in favour 
of this intervention. The GDG members agreed 
that the evidence was not sufficient for a strong 
recommendation. However, there was consensus 
that the intervention encompassed by this good 
practice statement does more good than harm, 
and that not including the intervention in efforts 
to increase contraceptive use among adolescents 
would be contrary to practice norms. Thus, the GDG 
agreed that a good practice statement would be most 
appropriate. 
The GDG noted that the intervention is likely to be 
acceptable to adolescents, their families and the 
broader community. While meaningful engagement 
of adolescents will require human and financial 
resources, the GDG considered such interventions 
to be feasible in most contexts. Overall, there was 
strong consensus among the GDG members that the 
intervention would promote gender equality and 
advance equity, more generally.
Of all the implementation stages, the GDG highlighted 
that meaningful engagement of adolescents is 
potentially the most critical in the design stage and 
in monitoring and evaluation for accountability 
purposes through a human rights-based approach 
(84). Finally, it was noted that meaningful 
engagement of adolescents requires additional time, 
effort and funding, and that this should be accounted 
for in workplans and budgets, and encouraged and 
supported by agencies that provide technical and 
financial support.

4. Analytic framework for selecting 
evidence-based interventions for 
implementation
Putting oneself in the shoes of a policy-
maker or programme manager, how 
could one make use of these numerous 
recommendations and good practice 
statements to prevent early pregnancy 
and poor reproductive outcomes among 
adolescents in a way that is most appropriate 
and responsive to the needs of their 
countries and contexts?
The second edition of the Global accelerated action 
for the health of adolescents (AA-HA!): guidance to 
support country implementation, published in 2023 
by WHO, and developed by WHO in partnership with 
UNAIDS, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UN WOMEN, the 
World Food Programme and the Partnership for 
Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH), sets 
out a useful step-by-step process for responding to 
this question (106).
4.1 Setting priorities in adolescent 
health programmes
Chapter 4 of AA-HA! calls for national and 
subnational governments to identify and address 
adolescent health and well-being programming 
priorities because:
 y the scope for adolescent health and well-being 
programmes is very broad;
 y the nature, scale and impact of adolescent 
health and well-being needs are unique in each 
country; and
 y all governments face resource constraints, and so 
they must make difficult choices to ensure that 
resources are used most effectively (106).
It calls for the process of national prioritization to 
be explicit, transparent and involve all relevant 
stakeholders across key sectors, and that this process 
should include: 
 y a needs assessment to identify which conditions 
have the greatest impact on adolescent health, 
well-being and development, both among 
adolescents by age, sex and part of the country and 
among those most vulnerable;
 y a landscape analysis of existing adolescent health 
and well-being programmes, policies, legislation, 
capacity and resources within the country, as well 
as a review of current global and local guidance on 
evidence-based interventions; and
 y setting priorities by applying explicit criteria such 
as the magnitude and public health importance 
of the issue; the potential to address the needs 
of vulnerable populations and poorly served 
groups; the existence of effective, appropriate 
and acceptable interventions to reduce priority 
burdens; and the feasibility of delivering the 
intervention(s) and potential to go to full 
scale (106).
The case for investing in adolescent health is 
described in detail in the AA-HA! guidance (106); it 
focuses on the following five key messages.
 y Adolescents have a fundamental right to health, 
and yet they bear a substantial proportion of the 
global disease and injury burden.
 y Investments in adolescent health and well-being 
bring a triple dividend of health and well-being 
52
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
benefits – for adolescents now, for adolescents in 
the future, and for the next generation.
 y Investments in adolescent health and well-being 
bring substantial economic benefits and enhance 
human and social capital.
 y Adolescents are not simply old children or young 
adults, they have particular needs.
 y The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 
cannot be achieved without investment in 
adolescent health and well-being.
The case for investing in adolescent SRH, and 
specifically in prevention of early pregnancy and 
poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents, 
has also been articulated in detail elsewhere (1, 
107-109). These arguments emphasize the costs and 
consequences of adolescent pregnancy, including 
maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, 
disruptions to educational attainment, limitations to 
future employment opportunities, and perpetuated 
cycles of poverty and inequality. Likewise, they 
describe the powerful and far-reaching positive 
impact of delayed pregnancy on the health and well-
being of adolescents and the next generation, as well 
as on broader gender equality and social progress. 
Addressing this issue is essential to realizing the full 
potential of adolescents and achieving sustainable 
development outcomes. 
Once consensus has been reached on the need for 
and importance of preventing early pregnancy and 
poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents, 
the next step is to set priorities within this objective. 
An important point of departure is that adolescent 
girls and boys are a diverse group at different stages 
of personal development, and living and developing 
in different social, economic and cultural contexts. 
These differences reinforce the need to understand 
the realities of key subgroups of adolescents and to 
tailor our approaches to their needs, preferences and 
contexts (110).
Armed with the findings of the levels of child 
marriage and adolescent contraceptive use and the 
determinants of these conditions/behaviours among 
different groups, one could then make choices from 
the menu of recommendations and good practice 
statements in these guidelines. The two frameworks 
described below can facilitate well-informed and 
well-considered decision-making.
4.1.1 Choosing from a menu of proven 
interventions to prevent child marriage 
to address the principal drivers of child 
marriage in a setting/context
A framework developed by Population Council 
provides a useful basis for matching interventions to 
the determinants of child marriage in a setting. It sets 
out five categories of factors that contribute to child 
marriage, and then five categories of interventions to 
address them (53). 
The framework proposes that two distal drivers 
(social norms and attitudes, and poverty and 
economic factors) underlie three more proximal 
factors that lead to child marriage (lack of agency, 
lack of opportunity, and fear of girls’ sexuality and 
pregnancy). These drivers operate at community, 
household and individual levels, and each of 
these drivers is likely to affect some girls and their 
families more than others. For example, in a highly 
conservative middle-class family living in a big city, 
prevailing social norms may be a far more important 
driver than economic constraints. Further, some or 
all of these drivers could intersect and compound 
their effects.
In addition, in a family living in an impoverished peri-
urban community, family poverty may be amplified 
by lack of educational and work opportunities in 
the community. These drivers may also influence 
short-, medium- and long-term outcomes for girls 
and their families. For example, poverty, lack of 
agency and lack of opportunity could worsen the 
family’s economic situation, potentially leading 
to psychological distress and/or intimate partner 
violence. 
Interventions to address the drivers of child marriage, 
meanwhile, are placed in five broad categories: 
 y empowerment programmes which aim to increase 
girls’ agency and equip them with knowledge and 
skills to avoid child marriage; 
 y community engagement programmes which aim 
to address social norms by sensitizing parents and 
community members to the risks of child marriage; 
 y educational interventions which encourage 
support for continued education as an alternative 
to marriage;
 y economic support programmes which aim to 
alleviate pressures and offer financial incentives for 
53
4. Analytic framework for selecting evidence-based interventions for implementation  
certain behaviours, such as delaying marriage and 
keeping girls in school; and 
 y legal or policy interventions which aim to create 
a legal and policy environment that makes child 
marriage more difficult.
As discussed above, the drivers of child marriage 
vary between and within settings, and interventions 
that are effective in one context may be less effective 
in another. A clear understanding of the drivers 
in a particular context can contribute to a better-
informed choice of a package of interventions from 
the available menu. For example, in the context 
of economic hardship caused by an intense and 
prolonged drought, an economic support programme 
combined with an educational intervention may 
be more effective than laws and policies or an 
empowerment programme on its own. 
4.1.2 Choosing from a menu of proven 
interventions to increase access to, use of, 
and continued use of contraception among 
adolescents based on an understanding 
of the drivers of non-/low use in a setting/
context
A framework developed by the International Center 
for Research on Women (ICRW) provides a useful basis 
for matching interventions to promote the uptake of 
contraception with an understanding of the decisions 
that individuals and couples make and the context 
in which these decisions occur. It sets out three 
demand-side and two supply-side factors influencing 
contraceptive decision-making by adolescents, and 
proposes interventions to address each (111). 
Demand-side factors
Desire to avoid, delay, space or limit childbearing
In contexts in which early childbearing within or 
outside marriage/union is socially accepted or even 
encouraged, early pregnancy is likely to be intended 
and wanted. Thus, efforts to increase contraceptive 
awareness and access are likely to have little effect 
on their uptake. Rather, initiatives that address 
poverty and social disadvantage, including lack of 
access to education and employment opportunities, 
are required. These efforts should be combined 
with complementary efforts to reduce child/
early marriage, which is a major contributor to 
adolescent childbearing.
Desire to use contraception
Some adolescents do not desire to use contraception 
because of fear of side-effects, because they 
mistakenly believe it could prevent them from getting 
pregnant in the future, and/or because they believe 
that its use conflicts with their traditions and religious 
directives. In this context, information and education 
on contraception are required, including efforts to 
understand and address myths and misconceptions.
Agency to use contraception
Some adolescents lack the agency, self-assurance 
and/or independence to use contraception. They may 
be reluctant to admit that they are sexually active or 
embarrassed to seek contraception. They may face 
opposition from their partners or influential family 
members such as mothers-in-law, who – in some 
settings – can overrule decisions they make. In such 
contexts, efforts to build adolescent girls’ abilities 
to make decisions and negotiate decisions about 
childbearing and contraceptive use are required, 
as are efforts to engage and support their male 
partners in shared decision-making. Depending on 
the social context, young men may also lack the 
confidence and independence to seek contraception. 
That is why, alongside efforts to reach young 
people, complementary efforts are needed to build 
support for contraceptive use among family and 
community members.
Supply-side factors
Access to contraceptive services
In some settings, laws and policies prevent the 
provision of contraception based on age or marital 
status. Further, adolescents may be unaware about 
where (or when) contraceptives are available, 
unable to reach a contraceptive service-delivery 
point, or unable to afford them. Barriers such as 
inaccessible service locations and cost negatively 
affect adolescents as well as adults. However, they 
disproportionally affect adolescents, as they often 
have limited ability to move around and financial 
autonomy to pay for service fees and transport. In 
such contexts, efforts to enable adolescents to access 
contraceptive services are required.
Provision of quality adolescent-friendly services
In many contexts, health workers have knowledge 
gaps and misconceptions about contraceptive service 
provision. They may believe that contraceptive 
methods, and especially long-acting methods, 
54
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
should not be used by adolescents who have not 
yet had a child. They may not be aware that when 
adolescents use contraceptives, they are more 
likely to use them for shorter periods than adults, 
and are more likely than adults to discontinue use 
because they are particularly sensitive to side-effects. 
They may also not be aware that adolescents are 
at higher risk of rapid repeat pregnancies because 
of lack of awareness and misconceptions about 
return to fertility. Health workers may also lack the 
knowledge and skills to respond to the specific 
needs of adolescents. In particular, they may lack 
the knowledge or skills to assess the cognitive, 
psychological and social situation of their adolescent 
clients, and to offer contraception as a means of 
achieving their life goals, using approaches such 
as motivational interviewing and aspirational 
counselling. Finally, in many contexts, health 
workers believe that it is wrong for adolescents 
to be sexually active before marriage. Together, 
these challenges translate into judgemental and 
disrespectful behaviour.
4.2 Balancing efforts to achieve 
global targets with efforts to 
understand and respond to local 
needs
Programme managers face different and competing 
pressures. On the one hand, they are asked to step 
up implementation efforts to achieve SDG targets. On 
the other hand, the differing drivers of child marriage 
and adolescent contraceptive use in different settings 
point to the need for local responses. How could 
a programme manager at a district or subdistrict 
level ensure that the response they are putting in 
place is appropriately tailored to their specific local 
context, and at the same time is in line with calls 
from the national, regional and global levels? The 
HIV approach of “know your epidemic, tailor your 
response” provides a useful model (112).
For HIV prevention, this approach recognized that 
there was no single global HIV epidemic, but rather, 
a multitude of diverse epidemics. The strategy thus 
involved the following: understanding the drivers 
in each setting, prioritizing or phasing responses 
accordingly, setting measurable targets, tailoring 
prevention plans, and using strategic information to 
stay on course. 
For adolescent pregnancy prevention, this would 
similarly require a recognition that there are many 
“hotspots” , each with its own complicated set of 
intersecting drivers. At the same time, as Wilson and 
Halperin (113) have stressed, the approach should 
seek to avoid the following pitfalls of the HIV model:
 y overcomplicating tailored approaches to the point 
where one is unable to act decisively
 y over-reliance on mathematical modelling without 
careful triangulation
 y ensuring that responses are grounded in evidence 
so as to avoid compromising rigour and 
 y knowing how to bring about social and normative 
change to address cross-cutting drivers.
Nevertheless, the model provides useful lessons 
for developing adolescent pregnancy prevention 
strategies that include clear targets for different 
scenarios or patterns of child marriage at the local 
level, with transparent leadership, coordination and 
accountability at national and global levels.
4.3 Employing an explicit and 
directive equity focus to leave no 
one behind
Around the world, adolescents from some families 
and communities are being left behind in progress 
on child marriage and prevention of adolescent 
pregnancy (4). They include those who live in remote 
rural areas or in deprived peri-urban areas; those 
from poor families; those with little education; 
those from historically marginalized groups; those 
with disabilities; and those affected by conflict 
and displacement. While a focus on the drivers of 
child marriage and adolescent contraceptive use 
at the local level can contribute to identifying the 
differing ways in which adolescents in different 
families and communities are affected, there is still 
a risk that those who are most marginalized could 
be left behind. Numerous tools are available in 
the public arena to integrate an equity focus into 
monitoring and evaluation efforts. Two examples are 
WHO’s Inequality monitoring in sexual, reproductive, 
maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and 
WHO’s Innov8 approach for reviewing national health 
programmes to leave no one behind (114, 115).
WHO’s Inequality monitoring in sexual, reproductive, 
maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health 
55
4. Analytic framework for selecting evidence-based interventions for implementation  
provides a step-by-step manual to strengthen 
and build capacity for quantitative monitoring of 
inequality (114). It begins in Step 1 with efforts to 
determine the scope of monitoring and to decide 
in Step 2 upon the best available data. Programme 
managers are then guided in Step 3 to perform data 
analyses, in Step 4 to report findings, and in Step 5 
to translate knowledge into action. The step-by-
step manual is complemented with a companion 
workbook with exercises to guide the process of 
inequality monitoring in sexual, reproductive, 
maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health, and 
a template to map potential data sources.
WHO’s Innov8 Approach aims to support 
operationalization of the concept of leaving no one 
behind, by making policies and programmes more 
equity-oriented, rights-based and gender-responsive, 
while addressing critical social determinants of 
health (115). It guides users through a review 
and decision-making process to be undertaken 
by a multidisciplinary team, often comprising 
representatives from national and sub-national health 
authorities, research institutes, civil society and non-
governmental organizations, and other sectors. It 
begins with the completion in Step 1 of a diagnostic 
checklist and an articulation in Step 2 about how 
the programme is expected to produce the desired 
results (a “programme theory”). Using available 
evidence, Steps 3 and 4 respectively identify the sub-
populations not being reached by or benefiting less 
from the programme and the factors that prevent or 
hinder and facilitate effective coverage, serving to test 
the “programme theory” . In Step 5, the mechanisms 
underpinning these barriers and generating 
inequities and discrimination are examined. In 
Step 6, the review team considers how to overcome 
these barriers and challenges including through 
the enhancement of intersectoral action and social 
participation. A transformative redesign proposal 
is developed in Step 7 that includes a set of action-
oriented, targeted recommendations for adjustments 
to make the programme more equity-oriented, 
rights-based and gender-responsive and to address 
critical social determinants. Step 8 looks at how to 
monitor the proposed programme enhancements 
and to adjust the ongoing monitoring and evaluation 
framework to ensure sustained attention to leaving 
no one behind. The Innov8 approach has been used 
in relation to a range of programme areas – including 
adolescent health – in a variety of settings. It has 
been adapted, tailored to and aligned with country-
specific and programmatic contexts and existing 
review processes.
4.4 Monitoring and evaluating 
programmes and projects to 
prevent child marriage and 
improve the health and well-
being of married girls, and to 
improve access to, uptake of, and 
continued use of contraception by 
adolescents
A useful framework that can be used to monitor and 
evaluate policies and programmes is the International 
Health Partnership (IHP+) Common Monitoring 
and Evaluation Framework (116, 117). Using this 
framework, a policy-maker or programme manager is 
guided to set out indicators in five categories: 
 y inputs (e.g. financing, human resources)
 y processes (e.g. supply chain and mechanisms for 
sharing information)
 y outputs (e.g. availability of services and 
interventions and their quality)
 y outcomes (e.g. intervention coverage and 
prevalence of risk behaviours) and 
 y impact (e.g. health impact and system efficiency).
With regard to evaluation, the AA-HA! guidance 
recommends that policy-makers and programme 
managers use the Development Assistance Committee 
criteria (118), namely: 
 y relevance (i.e. consistency with the overall policy or 
programme goal and its desired impact);
 y effectiveness (i.e. reasons for achievement, or not, 
of the policy or programmes’ main objective[s]);
 y efficiency (i.e. cost of resources – whether high or 
low – to achieve results);
 y impact (i.e. the difference the policy or programme 
made to beneficiaries); and 
 y sustainability (i.e. the likelihood that policy or 
programme benefits will continue in the absence of 
external support).
The AA-HA! guidance proposes a core set of 
adolescent health indicators, for the purpose of 
harmonizing efforts around adolescent health 
measurement and reporting, some of which relate to 
adolescent SRH (106) (see Box 4.1).
56
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
Box 4.1 Recommended indicators for monitoring and evaluating adolescent sexual 
and reproductive health
The Global Accelerated Action for the Health of 
Adolescents (AA-HA!): Guidance to Support Country 
Implementation proposes a core set of adolescent 
health indicators, for the purpose of harmonizing 
efforts to measure and report adolescent health, 
some of which relate to adolescent SRH (106). 
Most of these indicators are in the categories of 
outcomes or impact. Indicators in the categories 
of inputs, processes and outputs will need to be 
defined based on the specific intervention and 
context in which it will be implemented, taking 
into account practical considerations and the 
available data sources.

Annex 3. Guideline development 
process and methodology
The WHO guideline on preventing early 
pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes 
among adolescents in low- and middle-
income countries, second edition was 
prepared in accordance with WHO standards 
and methods for guideline development. 
Details of the approach can be found in the WHO 
handbook for guideline development, second edition 
(1). The WHO Department of Sexual and Reproductive 
Health and Research (SRH) led the development of 
this guideline. This annex gives an overview of the 
standards, methods and processes applied across the 
topics covered in this guideline.
Guideline development  
working groups
The SRH Department set up three working groups to 
perform specific guideline development functions: 
the WHO Guideline Steering Group, the Guideline 
Development Group (GDG) and the External 
Review Group (ERG). The members of the groups 
were selected to ensure a range of expertise and 
experience, including appropriate representation 
in terms of geography and gender. The following 
sections describe the three groups, and the names 
and institutional affiliations of the participants of 
each are listed in Annex 1.
The WHO Guideline Steering Group
Due to the nature of the guideline, the Guideline 
Steering Group included representation and 
expertise in sexual and reproductive health and 
rights (SRHR), adolescent health, gender, and 
human rights. Additionally, WHO representation 
provided expert perspectives, from the start of the 
guideline development process, on implementation 
considerations for the recommendations and good 
practice statements in various geographic regions.
The Guideline Steering Group, chaired by the 
SRH Department, led the guideline development 
process. The members initiated a scoping review 
and consultative process to define the scope of 
the guideline, identified and drafted the priority 
questions in the population, intervention, 
comparator and outcome(s) (PICO) format, and 
identified individuals to participate as a guideline 
methodologist and members of the systematic 
review teams, the GDG and the ERG. The Guideline 
Steering Group did not determine or agree on the 
final recommendations, as this is the role of the GDG 
as per WHO’s standards and methods for guideline 
development. The Guideline Steering Group finalized 
and published the guideline, will oversee the 
dissemination of the guideline, and will be involved in 
the development of derivative products.
Guideline Development Group
The Guideline Steering Group identified and invited 
external (non-WHO) experts in SRHR, adolescent 
health, gender, and human rights to serve as 
members of the GDG. These experts included 
researchers, policy-makers, programme managers, 
civil society members, and young people themselves. 
All WHO regions were represented, and the GDG was 
balanced with regard to gender.
The specific tasks of the GDG included:
 y reviewing the draft questions in PICO format 
drafted by the Guideline Steering Group;
 y choosing and ranking the priority outcomes 
to guide the evidence reviews and focus 
the recommendations;
 y examining the Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) 
76
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
profiles of the certainty of evidence used to inform 
the recommendations;
 y interpreting the evidence, with explicit 
consideration of the overall balance of benefits 
and harms;
 y formulating recommendations and good practice 
statements, taking into account benefits, harms, 
values and preferences, acceptability, feasibility, 
resource requirements, equity and other factors, 
as appropriate;
 y identifying methodological issues and evidence 
gaps, and providing guidance on how to address 
these; and
 y reviewing and approving the final 
recommendations prior to submission to the 
Guidelines Review Committee.
The GDG co-chairs had equal responsibilities and 
complementary expertise and perspectives in areas 
that were relevant to this guideline, came from two 
different WHO regions, and represented a gender 
balance. They also had experience in consensus-
based processes. At the start of the first convening 
(described below), the nomination of the co-chairs 
was presented to and approved by the GDG.
The GDG convened four times throughout the 
guideline development process. 
The first convening consisted of two 3-hour sessions 
held on the Zoom remote meeting platform in 
July 2022. Its objectives were to (i) introduce the 
methodologist and the members of the GDG, the 
systematic review teams, and the Guideline Steering 
Group; (ii) provide an overview of the 2011 edition of 
the guideline and the rationale for updating it;  
(iii) discuss the process that will be used to update the 
guideline; and (iv) review and discuss the proposed 
PICO questions, and agree on the final version that 
will be used for the guideline.
The second convening consisted of one 2-hour 
session held on Zoom in March 2023. Its objectives 
were to (i) summarize the steps undertaken thus far to 
update the guideline; (ii) review the PICO questions, 
which were finalized based on feedback received 
during the first convening of the GDG and shared by 
email in October 2022; (iii) provide an update on the 
current status of the evidence synthesis and appraisal 
processes; (iv) invite advice and suggestions from the 
GDG for the systematic review teams in completing 
the evidence reviews; and (v) provide an overview of 
the remaining process for updating the guideline.
The third convening took place in person over three 
days at the John Knox Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, 
in June 2023. Its objectives were to (i) review the 
evidence syntheses and appraisals prepared by the 
systematic review teams and methodologist; and  
(ii) decide on recommendations and/or good practice 
statements to be included in the updated guideline.
Finally, the fourth convening consisted of one 2-hour 
session held on Zoom in August 2023. Its objectives 
were to (i) provide an update on additional analyses 
conducted since the third convening of the GDG; 
(ii) receive feedback on the report of the third 
convening and agree on a process for its finalization; 
and (iii) discuss the remaining process for updating 
the guideline, including writing the guideline, 
developing a dissemination plan, and developing a 
research agenda.
External Review Group
To establish the ERG, the Guideline Steering Group 
requested the WHO regional advisors responsible 
for adolescent sexual and reproductive health and 
rights (ASRHR) to identify one country in their region 
that had made notable progress in preventing child 
marriage and/or increasing access to, uptake of, and 
continued use of contraception among adolescents. 
In Argentina, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, the Republic 
of Moldova, the Philippines and Yemen, teams of 
stakeholders with expertise and interest in the 
promotion of ASRHR were then established. These 
teams consisted of health workers, researchers, 
policy-makers, programme managers, members 
of civil society, and young people themselves. The 
country teams were then requested to provide 
inputs to the guideline development process at 
two important junctures: (i) before the finalization 
of the PICO questions prepared by the Guideline 
Steering Group, so that the questions took into 
account country-level needs and priorities; and (ii) 
after the formulation of the recommendations and 
good practice statements by the GDG to provide 
technical feedback, identify factual errors, comment 
on the clarity of the language and provide input on 
implementation considerations. It was not within the 
ERG’s remit to change the recommendations or good 
practice statements formulated by the GDG.
77
Annex 3. Guideline development process and methodology
Declarations of interests by 
external contributors
All proposed GDG members were requested to 
submit a signed WHO declaration-of-interests form. 
Two members of the Guideline Steering Group 
independently reviewed the declaration-of-interests 
forms. The reviewers considered all possible conflicts 
of interest based on the latest guidance from the WHO 
Guidelines Review Committee, including placing a 
particular focus on possible financial or personal 
non-financial conflicts.
On confirmation of their eligibility to participate, 
all GDG members were instructed to notify the 
responsible technical officer of any change in relevant 
interests during the guideline development process, 
directly before each GDG convening. There were 
no cases of conflicts of interest that warranted any 
management or assessment by the WHO Office of 
Compliance, Risk Management and Ethics.
No member had a financial conflict of interest, and 
the GDG co-chairs did not present any conflicts of 
interest. A summary of the declaration-of-interests 
statements and information on how conflicts of 
interest were managed are included in Annex 2.
Defining the scope and topic areas 
for new recommendations and 
good practice statements
The Guideline Steering Group began by consulting 
with the target audience of the 2011 edition of the 
guideline to determine whether they believed an 
updated edition would be helpful to inform their 
work. There was overwhelming consensus that it 
would be helpful. Next, working within the general 
scope of the guideline, as presented in Chapter 1, 
section 1.4, while also considering the intended 
users and the intention of addressing both an 
enabling environment and specific relevant health 
interventions, the Guideline Steering Group mapped 
all existing WHO guidance relevant to preventing 
early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes 
among adolescents, specifically in relation to the 
six outcomes addressed in the 2011 edition of 
the guideline:
 y reduce marriage before the age of 18 years
 y reduce pregnancy before the age of 20 years
 y increase use of contraception by adolescents at risk 
of unintended pregnancy
 y reduce coerced sex among adolescents
 y reduce unsafe abortion among adolescents and 
 y increase use of skilled antenatal, childbirth and 
postnatal care among adolescents.
The Guideline Steering Group then reviewed 
these and other materials to identify topic areas 
for which new recommendations and/or good 
practice statements were needed. Given that the 
United Nations published a revised edition of 
the International technical guidance on sexuality 
education (2) in 2018 and International technical 
and programmatic guidance on out-of-school 
sexuality education (3) in 2020, and WHO published 
recommendations for Intrapartum care for a positive 
childbirth experience (4) in 2018, an updated edition 
of the evidence-to-action brief on Companion of 
choice during labour and childbirth for improved 
quality of care (5) in 2020, Guidelines for the health 
sector response to child maltreatment (6) in 2019, 
the RESPECT framework for preventing violence 
against women and girls (7) in 2019, and Abortion care 
guideline (8) in 2022, the Guideline Steering Group 
decided to update the sections on the following 
two components:
 y preventing child marriage and responding to the 
needs and rights of married girls; and 
 y improving access to, uptake of, and continued use 
of contraception among adolescents.
While two separate evidence synthesis and appraisal 
processes were conducted, the Guideline Steering 
Group ensured a strong link between the two 
components given their interrelated – and often 
reinforcing – nature.
Next, the specific questions to be addressed in the 
updated guideline within these two topics were 
scoped and refined through technical consultations 
with external experts representing a variety of 
stakeholder groups and geographic regions.
For the first component – preventing child marriage 
and responding to the needs and rights of married 
girls – in partnership with Girls Not Brides and the 
UNFPA–UNICEF Global Programme to End Child 
78
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
Marriage, the SRH Department organized a technical 
consultation in October 2019 to review advances in 
research and programmatic experience since the 
publication of a previous set of research priorities on 
child marriage in 2015.
For the second component – improving access 
to, uptake of, and continued use of contraception 
among adolescents – the SRH Department organized 
a technical consultation in October 2019 with the 
Full Access, Full Choice Project at the University 
of North Carolina, Family Planning 2020, and the 
United States Agency for International Development 
(USAID). The aim was to identify updated research 
and measurement needs on adolescent contraception 
since the publication of the 2011 edition of the 
guideline. Additionally, a scoping review was carried 
out in collaboration with the Full Access, Full Choice 
Project to identify the relevant amount and type of 
evidence that addressed areas of interest for the 
second component, with the intention of determining 
which questions would require de novo systematic 
reviews, and which would require additional evidence 
beyond systematic reviews.
Based on these processes, the Guideline Steering 
Group drafted an initial list of the PICO questions, 
which were subsequently reviewed and finalized by 
the GDG and ERG, as described above.
Reviewing the evidence and 
formulating the recommendations
Defining and reviewing priority questions
The development of the new recommendations and 
good practice statements on the two components 
described above began with formulating the 
following PICO questions:
Preventing child marriage and responding to the needs and rights of married girls
1.  Do interventions to empower girls by building their protective assets and/or promoting positive gender 
socialization reduce child marriage?
2a.  Do interventions to build gender-equitable attitudes, norms and behaviours among boys (as peers and/or 
partners) and/or men (as partners or fathers) reduce child marriage?
2b.  Do interventions to build awareness of and change attitudes and norms about child marriage, the rights 
of girls, and gender equality among parents/guardians of girls and boys and/or the broader community 
reduce child marriage?
3.  Do the following types of incentives reduce child marriage: 
 y conditional financial incentives

81
Annex 3. Guideline development process and methodology
Full details of the population, intervention, 
comparator and outcomes for each PICO question are 
presented in Annex 4.
Assessing the certainty of the evidence for 
recommendations
When formulating the recommendations and good 
practice statements, the GDG’s deliberations were 
informed by the certainty of the available evidence 
and its expert opinions, in accordance with the WHO 
guideline development process. WHO utilizes the 
GRADE approach to developing recommendations 
(1). This approach specifies four levels of certainty of 
evidence, which are described in Table A3.1.
Table A3.1 Description of the four levels of quality of evidence
Quality of evidence Rationale 
High We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the 
effect.
Moderate We are moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be 
close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially 
different.
Low Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially 
different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low We have very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be 
substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
The GRADE approach to appraising the certainty 
of quantitative evidence was used for all outcomes 
identified as critical for each of the PICO questions 
(see the Web Annex). Critical outcomes are those 
outcomes that are considered most important to 
individuals who are likely to be directly affected by the 
guideline. The rating of the outcomes was identified 
a priori by the GDG during the first convening. 
Following the completion of the evidence reviews, a 
GRADE Evidence-to-Decision table was prepared by 
the systematic review teams for each PICO question. 
These tables convey the judgements made by the 
GDG with respect to several factors, in addition to the 
benefits and harms and the certainty thereof, and 
includes the values and preferences of end users, 
resource use (including costs and cost-effectiveness), 
impact on human rights and equity, and acceptability 
and feasibility. The GRADE tables and the Evidence-to-
Decision tables are presented in the Web Annex. 
Determining the strength of a 
recommendation
A recommendation for an intervention indicates 
that it should be implemented; a recommendation 
against an intervention indicates that it should not be 
implemented. The strength of a recommendation – 
either “strong” or “conditional” – reflects the degree 
of confidence that the GDG has in the desirable 
effects of the recommendation outweighing the 
undesirable effects.
Desirable effects (i.e. benefits) may include beneficial 
health outcomes for individuals (e.g. reduced 
morbidity and mortality); reduced burden and/or 
costs for the individual, the family, the community, 
the programme and/or the health system; feasibility 
of implementation; and improved equity. Undesirable 
effects (i.e. harms) may include adverse health 
outcomes for individuals (e.g. increased morbidity 
82
WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
and mortality); and increased burden and/or costs 
for the individual, the family, the community, the 
programme and/or the health system. The burden 
and/or costs may include, for example, the resource-
use and cost implications of implementing the 
recommendations (which end users, health workers 
or programmes would have to bear), and the 
potential legal ramifications where certain practices 
are criminalized.
A strong recommendation (for or against the 
intervention) is one for which the GDG is confident 
that the desirable effects of the recommendation 
clearly outweigh its undesirable effects. The higher 
the certainty of the evidence base, the more likely 
that a strong recommendation can be made. On the 
other hand, a conditional recommendation is one 
for which the certainty of the evidence base may be 
low or may apply only to specific groups or settings. 
Alternatively, a conditional recommendation may be 
assigned where the GDG concludes that the desirable 
effects of the recommendation probably outweigh the 
undesirable effects or are closely balanced, but is not 
confident about these trade-offs in all situations.
An intervention that has received a conditional 
recommendation (i.e. recommended in specific 
contexts or recommended only in the context of 
rigorous research) should be implemented only in the 
appropriate context and should be monitored and 
evaluated. Further research will be needed to address 
the uncertainties, and this may provide new evidence 
that may change a future overall assessment of the 
certainty of the evidence.
Good practice statements are an alternative to 
strong or conditional recommendations when the 
quality of analysed evidence is low or very low, but 
there is high certainty based on indirect evidence, 
common knowledge, and/or GDG consensus that 
following the recommendation would result in more 
benefit than harm, and/or when not following the 
recommendation would fall outside current practice 
norms. In terms of implementation, good practice 
statements should be considered as equivalent to 
a strong recommendation; in other words, they 
are recommended for all or almost all populations 
and contexts.
The values and preferences of end users (or potential 
end users), in relation to the intervention and to the 
acceptability to health workers or other programme 
staff of implementing it, contribute to determining 
the strength of a recommendation, along with a 
consideration of the relevant resource use, feasibility, 
human rights, gender equality and equity issues  
(see Table A3.2).
83
Annex 3. Guideline development process and methodology
Table A3.2 GRADE domains considered when assessing the strength of recommendations
Domain Rationale
Benefits and harms When a new recommendation is developed, desirable effects (i.e. benefits) 
need to be weighed against undesirable effects (i.e. harms), considering any 
previous recommendation or another alternative. The larger the gap or gradient 
in favour of the benefits over the harms, the greater the likelihood of a strong 
recommendation.
Values and preferences If the recommendation is likely to be widely accepted or valued highly, the greater 
the likelihood of a strong recommendation. If there is a great deal of variability or 
strong reasons that the recommended course of action is unlikely to be accepted, 
the greater the likelihood of a conditional recommendation.
Economic/financial 
implications (costs/
resource use)
Lower costs (e.g. monetary, infrastructure, equipment, human resources) or 
greater cost-effectiveness are more likely to support a strong recommendation.
Feasibility The greater the feasibility of an intervention to all stakeholders, the greater the 
likelihood of a strong recommendation.
Equity and human 
rights
If an intervention will reduce inequities, improve equity or contribute to the 
realization of human rights, the greater the likelihood of a strong recommendation.
Acceptability If a recommendation is widely supported by stakeholders and there is widespread 
acceptance for implementation within the community, the greater the likelihood of 
a strong recommendation.
Decision-making by the GDG
The GDG members were guided by the structured and 
systematic process articulated in the WHO handbook 
for guideline development, second edition (1). All 
decisions were made by consensus. 
The GDG reviewed the evidence in the evidence 
syntheses and in the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision 
tables and discussed the topics under consideration, 
facilitated by the guideline methodologist and the 
GDG co-chairs. The GDG meeting was designed 
to allow participants to consider and judge each 
of the GRADE domains (see Table A3.2) and 
formulate recommendations through a process of 
group discussion, engagement and revision. The 
GDG was asked to decide on the direction of each 
recommendation (i.e. to recommend for or against 
an intervention) and on the format and strength of 
each recommendation (i.e. strong or conditional 
recommendation or good practice statement) 
as drafted. The methodologist sometimes asked 
participants to raise their hands in support of each 
separate option; this was not a formal vote but a 
decision-making aid to allow the methodologist 
and co-chairs to gauge the distribution of opinion 
and subsequently work towards consensus through 
further discussion. The final wording of each 
recommendation, including an indication of its 
direction and strength, was confirmed by consensus 
among all GDG members during the meeting, and 
through subsequent independent review of the text. 
The Evidence-to-Decision tables are presented in the 
Web Annex.

WHO guideline on preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
Compiling and presenting the 
guideline content
Following the GDG fourth convening, members of the 
WHO Guideline Steering Group prepared a draft of 
the full guideline document to accurately reflect the 
deliberations and decisions of the GDG.
The draft guideline was sent electronically to the GDG 
and the ERG for review. Any further modifications that 
the Guideline Steering Group made to the guideline 
were limited to the correction of factual errors and 
improvement in language to address any lack of 
clarity. The revised version was then submitted to the 
Guidelines Review Committee for approval; minor 
requested revisions were made before final copy-
editing and publication.
A description of the reviews conducted for the 
development of this guideline is presented in  
Web Annex. Evidence derived from the evidence 
reviews in support of the new recommendations and 
good practice statements is summarized in GRADE 
tables in the Web Annex. The Evidence-to-Decision 
tables are also presented in the Web Annex.

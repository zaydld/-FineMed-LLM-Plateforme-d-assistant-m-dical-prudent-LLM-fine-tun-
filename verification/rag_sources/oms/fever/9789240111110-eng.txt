1 Executive summary 
Scope: The purpose of this guideline is to assist health care providers caring for patients with 
suspected or confirmed arboviral disease caused by dengue, chikungunya, Zika or yellow 
fever viruses. This guideline includes recommendations on the management of patients 
admitted to health care facilities (defined for the purpose of this guidance as “severe disease”) 
and those seen in outpatient facilities (defined for the purpose of this guidance as “non-severe 
disease”).  
Target audience: This guideline is designed primarily for health care providers who manage 
patients with clinically apparent arboviral infections. The guideline can be applied at all levels 
of the health system, including community-based care, primary care, emergency departments 
and hospital wards.  
The guideline will also serve as a reference source for policymakers, health managers and 
health facility administrators to support the development of national, regional and local 
guidelines for epidemic and pandemic preparedness.  
This guideline provides recommendations on the following:  
• treatment for both severe and non-severe arboviral disease  
• choice of fluid management and measurements to guide fluid administration.  
• treatment with adjunctive therapies for patients with yellow fever 
Knowledge gaps are highlighted as priority areas for future research. 
Recommendations summary  
Recommendations for patients with non-severe, suspected or confirmed arboviral diseases 
(dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever):  
• WHO suggests the use of protocolized oral fluid treatment compared with non-
protocolized oral fluid treatment in patients with suspected or confirmed non-severe 
arboviral disease. [Conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence]  
• WHO suggests the use of paracetamol for the treatment of pain and/or fever in patients 
with suspected or confirmed non-severe arboviral disease. [Conditional 
recommendation, low certainty evidence]  
• WHO suggests the use of metamizole for the treatment of pain and/or fever in patients 
with suspected or confirmed non-severe arboviral disease. [Conditional 
recommendation, low certainty evidence]  
• WHO recommends against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications 
(NSAIDs) in patients with acute suspected or confirmed arboviral disease, irrespective 
of severity. [Strong recommendation, low certainty evidence]  
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever

• WHO suggests against using corticosteroid treatment in patients with acute suspected 
or confirmed non-severe arboviral disease [Conditional recommendation, low 
certainty evidence]  
Recommendations specific to patients with severe (hospitalized), suspected or confirmed 
arboviral disease (dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever):  
• WHO suggests using crystalloid fluid rather than colloid fluid in patients who require 
intravenous fluid treatment for suspected or confirmed severe arboviral disease. 
[Conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence]  
• WHO recommends the use of capillary refill time to guide intravenous fluid 
management in patients with suspected or confirmed severe arboviral disease. [Strong 
recommendation, low certainty evidence]  
• WHO recommends the use of lactate measurement in addition to standard care to 
guide intravenous fluid management in patients with suspected or confirmed severe 
arboviral disease. [Strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence]  
• WHO suggests the use of passive leg raise test in patients in shock, with suspected or 
confirmed arboviral disease, when the clinician is uncertain if further intravenous fluid 
administration is warranted. [Conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence]  
• WHO suggests against the use of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of patients 
with suspected or confirmed severe arboviral disease. [Conditional recommendation, 
very low certainty evidence]  
• WHO suggests against the use of immunoglobulins in the treatment of patients with 
suspected or confirmed severe arboviral disease. [Conditional recommendation, very 
low certainty evidence]  
• WHO suggests against the use of prophylactic platelet transfusion in patients with 
suspected or confirmed severe arboviral disease and platelet count of <50,000 
platelets/microlitre who have no active bleeding. [Conditional recommendation, low 
certainty evidence]  
• WHO suggests the use of intravenous N-acetylcysteine in the treatment of patients 
with liver failure due to suspected or confirmed yellow fever. [Conditional 
recommendation, very low-certainty evidence]  
• WHO recommends the use of monoclonal immunoglobulin TY014 in the treatment of 
patients with yellow fever only in research settings. [Use only in research]  
• WHO recommends the use of sofosbuvir in the treatment of patients with yellow fever 
only in research settings. [Use only in research] 
This guideline will be updated according to emerging evidence.

2 Introduction 
2.1 Background  
Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses are 
transmitted by Aedes (Stegomyia) species mosquitoes. These mosquitoes can also transmit 
yellow fever virus in urban settings. Aedes-borne arboviruses currently pose a public health 
threat in areas where approximately 3.9 billion people live. Although Aedes aegypti and Aedes 
albopictus mosquitoes are more abundant in tropical and subtropical than in temperate 
climates, their geographic scope is expanding and so too the risk of introduction and spread 
of the viruses they transmit. The simultaneous circulation, frequency, and magnitude of 
outbreaks of these arboviruses are increasing globally, fuelled by the convergence of ecologic, 
economic and social factors, with consequent expansion of areas in which cases occur. This 
increasing incidence in endemic areas and occurrence of imported and autochthonous 
(sometimes referred to as indigenous) disease cases in new areas require clinician awareness 
to recognize disease and manage cases according to evidence-based guidance, a task 
complicated by the challenges in differentiating clinically between these infections, 
particularly in the early phases of illness. 
In preparation for the 2022 Pan American Health Organization Guidelines for the Clinical 
Diagnosis and Treatment of Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika, a systematic review was 
conducted using various electronic databases and manual searches (1). Among other research 
questions, the review aimed to determine which clinical findings and basic complementary 
studies can differentiate diseases caused by arboviruses from each other and from other 
febrile diseases. The synthesis and evidence profiles were developed using the Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, with 
recommendations agreed upon by a panel of arbovirus experts. The methodology for these 
guidelines followed the WHO guideline development methods. Updated searches were not 
formally undertaken, as no recent large-scale studies were known to the panel; findings are 
incorporated here to aid end-users in refining their clinical judgements, but no formal 
recommendations have been made. For more detailed methodology information, please refer 
to the document (2).

The Tables 1.1 and 1.2 detail the clinical and laboratory findings that are potentially useful for 
guiding the diagnosis of suspected arbovirus infection based on the systematic review for the 
Pan American Health Organization guidelines. In a subsequent publication of the multicentre, 
prospective, observational study of early diagnostic indicators of dengue versus other febrile 
illnesses in Asia and Latin America, platelet count, white blood cell count and a change in 
these counts from the previous day of illness, as well as bleeding, anorexia, and skin flushing 
were identified as significant predictors of dengue, while cough and rhinitis were negative 
predictors of dengue (3).

2.2 Dengue  
Dengue is caused by infection with one of the dengue viruses (Orthoflavivirus dengue, 
serotypes 1-4), belonging to the family Flaviviridae (4). Although most people infected with 
dengue virus will not have symptoms, those who do typically experience abrupt onset high 
fever, body aches, arthralgia, retro-orbital headache, rash, and nausea. If symptoms occur, 
they usually begin 4–10 days after infection and last for 2–7 days, starting with a febrile phase, 
after which most patients will recover (Figure 2-1)(5). Other patients, often with increased 
capillary permeability, will enter the critical phase around the time of defervescence (fever 
reduction) on the 4th-5th day of illness, when warning signs become evident and when 
worsening of symptoms, organ dysfunction, and occasionally severe bleeding can occur; 
however, not all patients with severe dengue will have warning signs. 
Severe dengue can be fatal, and patients need care in a hospital for careful fluid management 
and to address complications of infection (6). Following the critical phase, patients typically 
enter the recovery phase with reabsorption of extravascular fluid. Most patients will recover in 
1–2 weeks.  
The risk of developing severe dengue increases when a person is infected with a second 
dengue virus serotype months to years after the initial infection. Risk can also be increased in 
patients with concomitant comorbidities or other conditions such as pregnancy, young age 
(particularly infants and young children) and advanced age. There are no known specific 
antiviral treatments for dengue virus infections. Medications can be used to manage pain and 
fever. However, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are typically avoided because of the 
risk of bleeding complications. Prevention of dengue hinges on avoidance of mosquito bites 
and community-level mosquito vector reduction.  
Vaccines have been developed and received stringent regulatory approvals. Use of vaccines, 
however, has been limited to date (7).  
Reported dengue cases have increased markedly in the past decade, with cases roughly 
doubling annually since 2021. Globally, 136 countries or territories have reported current or 
prior autochthonous dengue transmission. In 2024, over 14.2 million dengue cases were 
reported to WHO, including 7.5 million confirmed cases, over 52 000 severe cases and more 
than 10000 deaths (8). Most cases have been reported from the Region of the Americas where 
arbovirus surveillance is more consistent and robust than other Regions and all four dengue 
subtypes circulate (9). Most cases are reported from Brazil, and all member states except 
Canada have reported prior autochthonous dengue transmission.

In the African Region, there has been evidence of autochthonous transmission in more than 30 
countries, with 19 reporting transmission in 2024. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, seven 
countries have reported autochthonous transmission in 2024; dengue transmission in the 
Region is compounded by fragile, weakened health care systems, conflicts, and floods. In the 
South-East Asia Region, dengue is endemic in ten countries. From 2022-2023, the most 
significant increases in dengue cases were observed in Bangladesh and Thailand, and in 2024 
the highest case numbers were reported by Indonesia and India. Dengue is endemic in 23 
countries in the Western Pacific Region with recent large outbreaks in Malaysia and Viet Nam 
in 2023-2024. Although previously documented, large outbreaks have not been reported in 
Pacific Island Countries or territories in recent years. Sporadic autochthonous dengue cases 
and limited dengue outbreaks have been reported in the European Region since 2010 in 
France, Italy, Spain, Portugal (Madeira) and Croatia.

2.3 Chikungunya 
Chikungunya is caused by infection with chikungunya virus (Alphavirus chikungunya), 
belonging to the family Togaviridae. More than half of patients with chikungunya virus 
infection will experience symptoms that typically include fever and severe, sometimes 
incapacitating arthralgia. In symptomatic patients, disease onset is typically 4 – 8 days (range 
2 – 12 days) after the bite of an infected mosquito. Some patients develop severe 
chikungunya, which can be fatal, particularly in those with underlying medical conditions, 
elderly persons and neonates infected around the time of delivery in the presence of maternal 
viraemia or soon after birth through infected mosquito bites. Severe complications, including 
cardiovascular, neurological and multiorgan involvement, may require intensive medical care 
(8 – 10). There are no known specific antiviral treatments for chikungunya virus infections. 
Medications can be used to manage pain and fever. There is one vaccine approved in the 
United States of America and Europe for use in travellers and laboratory workers, but the 
vaccine is not widely available for public health use in endemic or outbreak settings. 
Chikungunya virus was first identified in the United Republic of Tanzania in 1952, and sporadic 
cases and outbreaks were reported in Africa and Asia from the 1950s and 1960s, respectively 
(13). Since 2004 outbreaks have become more frequent and widespread with spread of the 
virus into non-immune populations that was associated, in some outbreaks, with viral 
adaptations that facilitate transmission by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. 
Autochthonous chikungunya virus transmission has been identified in 119 countries across all 
WHO regions. In 2024, more than 460 000 suspected cases of chikungunya were reported 
globally. Most cases were reported from the Region of the Americas, where systematic 
chikungunya surveillance is in place across Member States and Territories. Since 2018, 
chikungunya cases were reported from 14-15 countries in the region annually and 
transmission during 2023 marked geographic expansion of reported cases, including a large 
outbreak in Paraguay, resumption of transmission in Argentina and the first recorded 
autochthonous transmission in Uruguay. In the African Region, limited outbreaks and 
sporadic cases had been recorded periodically since the 1950s, with a marked increase 
starting with a 2004 outbreak in Kenya, which spread to Indian Ocean islands. 
Outbreaks have been reported in countries across the African Region since that time. 
Chikungunya transmission has been reported from six countries in the Eastern Mediterranean 
Region, with outbreak activity reported in Pakistan in 2024. In the South-East Asia Region, 
cases are reported mostly from India on the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare website (14) 
and around 100 000 cases have occurred annually since 2020, with an increase noted in 2024; 
other countries in the Region have also experienced cyclical outbreaks within the past two 
decades(15). Periodic chikungunya outbreaks, introduced by viraemic travellers, were 
reported in Italy and France (European Region) between 2007 and 2017. In 2024, a single 
Introduction 
 9 
autochthonous chikungunya case was reported in mainland France, along with over ten cases 
in La Réunion, France. Autochthonous transmission has been reported in 20 countries in the 
Western Pacific Region, and large outbreaks of chikungunya were reported in several Pacific 
Island countries from 2011-2017. 
2.4 Zika 
Zika is caused by infection with Zika virus (Orthoflavivirus zikaense), belonging to the family 
Flaviviridae. Most people with Zika virus infection do not develop symptoms. Those who do 
typically have symptoms including rash with pruritus, conjunctivitis, fever, myalgia, 
arthralgia, malaise, and headache that last for 2 – 7 days. Although primarily transmitted by 
Aedes species mosquitoes, Zika virus can also be transmitted from mother to foetus during 
pregnancy, through sexual contact, transfusion of blood and blood products and organ 
transplantation. In 2016, WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern 
due to the association of Zika virus infection with clusters of microcephaly and other 
neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), encephalitis and myelitis (16). 
No vaccine or antivirals are yet available for the prevention or treatment of Zika virus 
infection, but this remains an active area of research. 
Cases of Zika virus disease declined from 2017 onwards globally, and many countries that 
instituted surveillance under the public health emergency have ceased testing and monitoring 
for transmission since then. However, Zika virus cases are still reported at low levels in several 
countries in the Region of the Americas and in other endemic regions, including outbreaks in 
India and Thailand.  
To date, a total of 92 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito-
transmitted Zika virus infection (17,18). In 2024, over 30 000 Zika cases were reported, with 
most from the Region of the Americas, where there is good surveillance for the disease (9). In 
the African Region, few countries are conducting testing for Zika; transmission was reported in 
multiple countries prior to 2024 but these have typically been sporadic cases detected during 
research projects (19). 
In the South-East Asia Region, autochthonous transmission of Zika occurs at low levels in 
several countries and periodic outbreaks have been reported, including in India (Maharashtra 
and Karnataka states) and in Thailand. In the European Region, Zika virus autochthonous 
transmission has only been reported in a single instance in France in 2019 and has not yet 
been reported from the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Sporadic Zika cases of have been 
reported in the mainland countries of the Western Pacific Region. Although the first recorded 
Zika outbreak occurred in Micronesia (Federated States of) in 2007, followed by a large 
outbreak in French Polynesia, France, in 2013, cases reported from Pacific Island countries 
have remained low since 2016. 
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
10 
2.5 Yellow fever 
Yellow fever is caused by infection with yellow fever virus (Orthoflavivirus flavi) belonging to 
the family Flaviviridae. It is transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitoes, primarily 
from the Aedes, Haemagogus and Sabethes species. Yellow fever disease affects both humans 
and non-human primates. 
Many infected people do not experience symptoms. For those who are symptomatic, 
symptoms appear after an incubation period of typically 3-6 days following a bite of an 
infected mosquito. The most common symptoms are fever, muscle pain with prominent 
backache, headache, loss of appetite and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms 
disappear after 3 – 4 days. A small percentage of patients enter a second, more toxic phase 
within 24 hours of recovering from initial symptoms. High fever returns and several body 
systems are affected, usually the liver and kidneys. In this phase, people are likely to develop 
jaundice, dark urine, and abdominal pain with vomiting. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, 
nose, eyes, or stomach. Half of these patients die within 7 – 10 days. More severe cases can be 
confused with severe malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis (especially fulminant forms), other 
haemorrhagic fevers, infection with other flaviviruses (including dengue) and poisoning. 
Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure, providing lifelong immunity in most 
cases. 
Yellow fever is transmitted through three distinct cycles: (1) sylvatic (or jungle); (2) 
intermediate or savannah yellow fever; and (3) urban yellow fever. The urban cycle involves 
the transmission of the virus between humans and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in densely 
populated areas, potentially leading to large epidemics. As of 2023, 34 countries in Africa and 
13 countries in Central and South America were either endemic for, or have regions that are 
endemic for, yellow fever. The threat of yellow fever outbreaks continues to affect countries in 
these regions. In the past six years, explosive outbreaks have seen yellow fever re-emerge as a 
major international public health threat in endemic areas, fuelled by insufficient vaccination 
coverage, climate factors, population growth and urbanization (20,21). 
In 2023, the African Region experienced yellow fever outbreaks in urban settings across three 
countries, cases with epidemic potential in three additional countries and sporadic cases in 
eight other countries. The transmission patterns in 2023 highlight the ongoing risk due to 
sylvatic transmission, spillover, and amplification into susceptible populations. In 2023, in the 
Region of the Americas, cases with exposure to sylvatic environment were reported from four 
countries (22). 
The long-term Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) strategy (2017-2026) was developed by 
WHO and partners to respond to the increasing risk of large urban yellow fever outbreaks with 
risk of international spread and threat to global health security(23). The EYE Strategy works 
Introduction 
 11 
across the full continuum of prevention, preparedness, and outbreak response. Through the 
efforts of this partnership more than 377 million people in Africa, as of 2024, have been 
protected for life through vaccination campaigns and routine immunization since 2017.

2.6 Laboratory confirmation  
Aedes-borne arbovirus infections often cannot be distinguished clinically because they share 
non-specific clinical features. Laboratory confirmation is therefore needed to differentiate 
these infections from each other and from other circulating arboviral and non-arboviral 
pathogens. However, such testing is not readily available in many parts of the world where 
Aedes-borne arboviruses circulate, leading to frequent misdiagnoses, and clinical 
management is guided by the clinical syndrome and prevailing epidemiology.  
Laboratory testing for arboviruses can be accomplished through either direct detection 
methods such as virus isolation, molecular detection of nucleic acid or antigen testing 
including rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) within the first week of illness onset, or indirect 
detection methods such as IgM and IgG antibodies ELISAs and RDTs from the end of the first 
week after illness onset to the first three months up to years later (27,28). Antigenic similarities 
within viral families can cause cross-reactivity on serologic testing that is notable among 
flaviviruses, particularly between Zika and dengue viruses (29). Serologic cross-reactivity has 
also been noted between alphaviruses including chikungunya, Mayaro virus (Alphavirus 
mayaro) in the Americas and O’nyong’nyong virus (Alphavirus onyong) in Africa.  
Laboratory guidance for the diagnosis of dengue in outbreak settings is under development, 
and updates are planned for Zika and chikungunya diagnostic testing. To guide countries in 
the selection of diagnostic tests, Expert Reviews for Procurement of Diagnostics are in 
progress for dengue.  
Existing guidelines on laboratory diagnosis are found at:  
• Laboratory manual for yellow fever (2024) (30) 
• Recommendations for Laboratory Detection and Diagnosis of Arbovirus Infections in 
the Region of the Americas (2023) (31)

Introduction

2.7 Identifying severe arboviral disease  
Dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever have unique WHO case definitions, and not all are 
accompanied by a classification of severity. The dengue severity classification outlined in the 
2009 WHO Dengue guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control includes 
categories of non-severe (with or without warning signs) and severe dengue (33). The case 
definitions for chikungunya proposed by an expert panel convened by WHO in 2015 included 
definitions for acute disease and severe acute disease (34). The proposed case WHO case 
definitions for Zika and the surveillance case definition for yellow fever do not include 
categorization into severe and non-severe disease: for Zika, because severe disease 
manifestations are rare outside of congenital disease and neurological syndromes (which 
have their own case definitions) (35); and for yellow fever because the case definition includes 
organ dysfunction (hepatic) resulting in jaundice that implies severe disease (36). The Pan 
American Health Organization recently issued updated dengue, chikungunya and Zika case 
definitions and dengue severity classification for the Americas based on the systematic review 
of clinical features differentiating arboviral infections conducted in 2022 (12). 
 Definitions of non-severe and severe arboviral disease in this guideline  
The heterogeneity in available case definitions and classifications across viral diseases and 
variations in case definitions and classifications across Regions and WHO Member States 
necessitated the development of a working definition for the purposes of evaluating evidence 
and developing clinical recommendations. Consequently, for the purposes of clarity in this 
guideline, the following terminology is used.  
Severe disease: those patients who clinicians assess as requiring hospitalization based on a 
clinical evaluation which includes assessment for the presence of warning signs and existing 
complications. 
Non-severe disease: those who do not have features of severe disease and can be managed 
on an out-patient basis.  
Based on the literature review from the 2022 Pan American Health Organization guidelines, 
the following criteria were identified that might encourage clinicians to hospitalize patients 
with dengue. 
• Dengue with warning signs: 
o abdominal pain: progressive until it is continuous or sustained and intense, and 
at the end of the febrile stage 
o sensory disorder: irritability, drowsiness, and lethargy 
o mucosal bleeding: bleeding gums, epistaxis, vaginal bleeding not associated 
with menstruation or more menstrual bleeding than usual and haematuria 
o hepatomegaly: more than 2 cm below the costal margin and abrupt onset  
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
14 
o vomiting: persistent (three or more episodes in one hour or four episodes in six 
hours) 
o progressive increase in haematocrit: on at least two consecutive measurements 
during patient monitoring. 
• dengue with criteria of severe disease, according to the WHO 2009 definition 
• oral intolerance 
• difficulty breathing  
• narrowing pulse pressure 
• arterial hypotension  
• acute renal failure  
• prolonged capillary refill time  
• pregnancy  
• coagulopathy 
In addition, clinicians in some settings may elect to admit to hospital those patients with 
other risk factors, such patients at the extremes of age (elderly, neonates) and those with 
underlying medical conditions at high risk for adverse disease outcomes.  
For Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever, the need for hospitalization will require individual 
assessment by the clinician.  
2.8 Purpose 
2.8.1 What are the guideline's objectives? 
• Describe standards of clinical care to improve patient management and therefore 
clinical outcomes.  
• Identify important uncertainties that require research and investigation. 
2.8.2 Guideline principles 
• Taking a patient perspective for outcomes, which entails prioritizing patient-important 
outcomes when assessing the certainty of evidence and making recommendations. 
• Recommendations that pertain to across areas with arbovirus transmission globally. 
• Recommendations that are inclusive and speak to the needs of vulnerable 
populations.

2.9 Scope and target audience 
Scope: The purpose of these guidelines is to assist health workers caring for patients with 
suspected or confirmed arboviral disease caused by dengue, chikungunya, Zika, or yellow 
fever viruses. The guidelines include recommendations on the management of patients 
admitted to health care facilities (defined for the purpose of this guidance as “severe disease”) 
and those seen in outpatient facilities (defined for the purpose of this guidance as “non-severe 
disease”). This guideline is not intended as an exhaustive clinical manual and should be read 
and implemented in the context of local clinical systems and arbovirus treatment practices. 
Prior WHO guidance includes more detailed information on clinical management (5,33). All 
specific recommendations within this guideline supersede those from previous documents. 
Target audience: The guidelines are designed primarily for health care providers who 
manage patients with clinically apparent arboviral infection. The guidelines can be applied at 
all levels of the health system including community-based care, primary care, emergency 
departments and hospital wards.  
The guidelines will also serve as a reference source for policymakers, health managers and 
health facility administrators to support the development of national, regional, and local 
guidelines for epidemic and pandemic preparedness.  
These guidelines provide recommendations on the following:  
• Supportive and symptomatic treatment for non-severe and severe arboviral infection.  
• Fluid management, including administration and monitoring of oral and intravenous 
fluids. 
• Specific and adjunctive therapies for patients with yellow fever.

3 Guideline development and implementation 
3.1 What triggered this update 
Prior WHO guidance for the clinical management of dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow 
fever have been based mostly on expert opinion, clinical practice experience and reviews of 
available evidence but without applying GRADE methodology.  
In 2022, the Pan American Health Organization and Member States developed and published 
guidelines emanating from the first GRADE-type evaluation of clinical management for 
dengue, chikungunya and Zika in the region (2).  
However, the considerations pertinent to the PAHO recommendations were specific to the 
Region of the Americas. There was thus a need for a similar process to be conducted at the 
global level and context, considering all WHO regions and Member States with endemic 
transmission and those where introduction is likely to occur over time. For those countries 
and subnational areas in which Aedes-borne arboviral diseases are now being detected for the 
first time, clinicians may be in particular need of guidance because of the lack of prior 
experience in caring for patients with these conditions.  
From a health care resource planning and preparedness perspective, the increasing size and 
frequency of arbovirus epidemics is placing additional strain on available facilities and 
personnel, and the capacity to improve patient outcomes through reduced hospital 
admissions and shorter durations of hospital stay are becoming ever more important. 
3.2 Guideline development process 
Introduction 
The development of these guidelines adheres to standards for trustworthy guidelines, 
including those of the United States Institute of Medicine (37), WHO (38) and GRADE working 
group (39,40). 
Timeline 
In May 2022, a WHO Steering Committee group was assembled (see authorship, contributions 
and acknowledgements section), with priority clinical questions related to arboviral disease 
management were identified. In April 2023, a written plan for the development of integrated 
clinical guidance for dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever was submitted to the WHO 
Guidelines Review Committee (GRC) for approval that included the proposed population, 
intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) questions and Guideline Development Group 
(GDG) members. The plan was approved after one revision on May 23, 2023.  
In 2023, the WHO Steering Committee appointed and convened the GDG for the clinical 
guidance of arboviruses approved by the GRC (see Authorship, contributions, and 
Guideline development and implementation 
 17 
acknowledgements section). The GDG is a multidisciplinary group comprised of 17 individuals 
from all WHO regions, including technical experts in arbovirus, researchers, primary care 
clinicians, paediatricians, emergency doctors, haematologists, neurologists, patient 
representatives and other stakeholders. For this guideline, the GDG also included specialists 
on ethics. WHO also ensured that the GDG was balanced for gender and representation from 
all WHO regions.  
The initial meeting of the GDG was held online on July 2023. At this initial meeting the chair 
and co-chairs were proposed and elected by the other members of the GDG and the initial 
PICO questions were discussed. The GDG convened in person on July 2024 to review the data 
gathered in the systematic review to address the PICO questions.  
3.2.1 Scope and formulation of PICOs 
The population of interest included persons with suspected or confirmed arboviral disease. 
Disease caused by infections with the following arboviruses were considered: 
• dengue 
• Zika 
• chikungunya 
• yellow fever 
The WHO Steering Committee and the GRC reviewed and revised this list and determined the 
clinical priorities and scope of the initial guideline. 
Questions were codified using a PICO framework, which identifies the population, 
intervention, comparator and outcomes of interest. These questions were then refined by the 
methodologist, technical team, and clinical chairs. The outcomes of interest were chosen 
based on their perceived importance to patients, as agreed upon by the GDG. 
3.2.2 Evidence identification and synthesis 
3.2.2.1 Identification of existing evidence 
An independent methodologist reviewed the proposed PICO questions and advised on 
refinement of the terminology and parameters and on optimal sequential ordering. PICOs 
previously framed as diagnostic identification of arbovirus illnesses compared with other 
febrile illnesses and differentiation of arboviruses were excluded from this systematic review, 
since the content was covered in the recent literature review conducted for the development 
of the PAHO guidance (2) that preceded this global guideline.  
In 2023, an independent research group specializing in systematic reviews for application to 
GRADE methodology was commissioned to perform a systematic review of randomized 
controlled studies (RCTs) on clinical diagnoses and treatment for arboviral diseases. The 
systematic review team analysed RCTs in all major databases, from database inception to 30 
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
18 
April 2024 that enrolled patients with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of arboviral disease 
(chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever or Zika) and compared interventions against placebo, 
standard care, or alternative interventions. For most PICOs there were no RCTs identified that 
specifically addressed the questions in patients with Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever. 
Studies of patients with dengue were assessed as indirect evidence for the other arboviral 
diseases. Similarly, for some of the PICOs addressing fluid management in patients with 
severe disease, only indirect evidence could be obtained from studies of patients with sepsis 
(6). The GDG considered the indirectness of this evidence as part of the GRADE evaluation. 
3.2.2.2 Additional evidence synthesis 
De novo reviews were undertaken where required using pre-defined protocol and search 
strategy. Evidence certainty was assessed using GRADE methodology (38). 
3.2.3 Values and preferences 
There were insufficient evidence-based descriptions of patient experiences or values and 
preferences regarding decisions for treatment based on a literature search. The GDG, 
therefore, relied on their own judgments of what well-informed patients would value after 
balancing the benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment. Judgements on values and 
preferences were crucially informed through the experiences of former patients represented 
in the GDG. 
The GDG agreed that the following values and preferences would be typical of well-informed 
patients:  
• “Most patients suffering from a non-severe disease, given its good prognosis, would be 
reluctant to use an intervention when it is uncertain if they would receive an overall 
benefit.”  
• “Most patients suffering from a severe disease, given its poor prognosis, would wish to 
use an intervention even when it is uncertain whether or not it has an overall benefit.”  
In addition to taking an individual patient perspective, the GDG also considered a population 
perspective in which feasibility, acceptability, equity, and cost were important considerations. 
Specific deliberations on values and preferences and associated feasibility and resource-
related considerations are presented for each recommendation. 
3.2.4 Priority outcomes and minimal important differences  
3.2.4.1 Priority outcomes 
The GDG identified patient-important critical and important outcomes through a structured 
online survey in which they were asked to assign a relative important of each. A pooled 
analysis of the mandatory survey was presented to the panel highlighting the most frequently 
identified. Further discussion de-emphasised proxy endpoints and limited the list to eight 
Guideline development and implementation 
 19 
outcomes. The GDG collectively agreed to this list of endpoints before being presented with 
any evidence summaries. Outcomes of critical interest were identified as follows:  
• duration of symptoms  
• hospitalization  
• length of hospital stay  
• mechanical ventilation  
• organ failure  
• major bleeding  
• severe adverse events  
• mortality. 
3.2.4.2 Minimal important difference (MID)  
The MID is defined as the smallest difference in outcome that informed patients would 
perceive as significant, whether beneficial or harmful. An intervention with impact less than 
the MID would not usually prompt its use in patient management (41). MIDs which are already 
in frequent use by other WHO clinical panels were presented to the GDG for ratification. In the 
case of organ failure and severe bleeding, no previous explicit MID had been used. The GDG 
were polled using a questionnaire which assessed the threshold for importance. The results 
were presented to the GDG for ratification. The final MIDs were agreed according to Table 3.1. 
Table 3-1.Minimally important difference for outcomes of interest 
Outcome MID 
Length of hospital stay 1 day 
Hospitalization 15 per 1000 
Duration of symptoms 1 day 
Mortality 3 per 1000 
Mechanical ventilation 15 per 1000 
Organ failure 15 per 1000 
Severe adverse events 15 per 1000 
3.2.5 Defining baseline risks  
To provide absolute risk estimates for the benefit of alternative interventions, this guideline 
used harmonized baseline rates of prioritized outcomes. Most of the evidence was obtained 
from studies involving participants with dengue, where the rates of most outcomes were 
lower for chikungunya and Zika, but similar or higher for yellow fever. However, following 
from the assumption that many patients will have unknown aetiology at the time of 
presentation, the guideline uses estimates from dengue.  
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
20 
To extract these, a systematic review obtained estimates of baseline absolute risks from 
observational studies for “mortality,” “bleeding” and “hospitalization”. This provided a wide 
range of estimates. To focus on a single point, the GDG panel were surveyed using discrete 
choices bounded by the outer estimates of observational studies (Annex 2). Using this survey, 
consensus of absolute risks was obtained and agreed at the meeting, as described in Table 
3.2. For yellow fever specific PICOs, baseline risks from the primary evidence were used.

3.2.6 GDG meeting: GRADE considerations for evidence to decision in the 
making of recommendations  
The GDG members (see authorship, contributions and acknowledgements) were convened in 
online meetings starting in July 2023. In July 2024, a hybrid (face-to-face and virtual) GDG 
meeting was held at WHO, Geneva, Switzerland, to review the results of the systematic review 
conducted by a consultant review team and formulate recommendations (Annex 3). At this 
meeting GRADE methodology was used to assess the overall certainty of evidence, which 
could not be higher than the lowest certainty rating for any outcome considered critical to 
informing a recommendation. 
Standard approaches to lowering or raising the level of certainty or confidence were used, 
including the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias, 
confounding bias, dose response or large effect (42). A GRADE methodologist was present at 
the July 2024 meeting to advise the GDG members on adherence to the methodology. 
The GDG decided a priori not to consider costs in determining the strength and direction of 
recommendations, since cost-effectiveness analyses were not performed. Nonetheless, the 
cost of interventions and the resources required for the application of the guidelines were 
discussed by the GDG members, as feasibility is an important component of the evidence-to-
decision framework.  
Guideline development and implementation 
 21 
The GDG noted that most of the intervention evidence originates from research on patients 
with dengue, making the evidence largely indirect for chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever. 
Furthermore, for PICOs regarding fluid administration, no eligible studies were identified in 
patients with any of these arboviral infections, and evidence from studies on patients with 
sepsis were considered, which is also indirect.  
3.2.7 GDG decision-making  
In making recommendations, the GDG considered the magnitude of benefits and harms, the 
certainty of evidence (very low, low, moderate and high) supporting estimates of the 
magnitude of benefits and harms and their belief regarding the values and preferences of 
stakeholders (in particular, patients with arboviral diseases). Interpretations of strong and 
conditional recommendations from the perspectives of patients, clinicians and policymakers 
appear in Table 3.3.

Patients Most individuals in this situation 
would want the recommended 
course of action; only a small 
proportion would not.  
Formal decision aides are not likely 
to be needed to help individuals 
make decisions consistent with their 
values and preferences.  
Most individuals in this situation would 
want the suggested course of action, but 
many would not. 
Clinicians Most individuals should receive the 
intervention. Adherence to the 
recommendation could be used as a 
quality criterion or performance 
indicator.  
Different choices will be appropriate for 
individual patients, who will require 
assistance in arriving at a management 
decision consistent with his or her 
values and preferences. Decision aides 
may be useful in helping individuals 
make decisions consistent with their 
values and preferences.  
Policymakers The recommendation can be 
adopted as policy in most situations.  
Policymaking will require substantial 
debate and involvement of various 
stakeholders.  
For more detail information, please refer to the WHO Handbook for guideline development (38).  
 
Deliberations on the direction and strength of recommendations were facilitated by the 
methodologist and clinical chairs. A priori voting rules (of 70% for consensus) informed 
procedures if the GDG failed to reach consensus by discussion, with the chairs absented from 
voting.  
The following factors informed the formulation of recommendations:  
• absolute benefits and harms for all patient-important outcomes through structured 
evidence summaries (e.g., GRADE summary of findings tables including effect 
estimates and confidence intervals or narrative summaries)  
• certainty of the evidence 
• values and preferences of patients 
• resources and other considerations (including considerations of feasibility, 
applicability, and equity).

 23 
Consistent with recent advice to guideline panels, the GDG attempted to make 
recommendations even when there is limited evidence and in the face of considerable 
uncertainty. Whenever possible, the GDG used research evidence to inform discussion around 
those key factors. In the absence of such evidence, discussion of these factors was informed 
by expert opinion of GDG members. 
Discussions on rationale, feasibility and accessibility, equity implications (if any) and 
implementation considerations were also documented. Equity implications included 
qualitative discussions of feasibility implications of any recommendations in favour of an 
intervention for constrained health care systems and in the context of other health care needs 
(such as supportive care) for the population of interest. This did not derive from empirical 
evidence of likely impact, but from principles of human rights and maximising public health 
impact. 
All recommendations were made by consensus. Polling was used to trigger and guide ongoing 
debate but was not used to decide any recommendation.  
3.2.8 Peer review and approval of the guidelines  
An external review group reviewed the final guideline document to identify, correct and clarify 
errors, contextual issues, and implications for implementation.  
The guideline was then reviewed and approved by the WHO Guideline Review Committee. 
3.3 Managing declarations of interest  
The technical unit collected and managed written statements of declarations of interest (DOI) 
(Annex 1). All DOI forms were reviewed by the WHO Secretariat. Consultation with WHO 
Quality Norms and Standards team and Ethics teams were obtained, when necessary. 
Conflicts of interest were declared by three panel members related to institutional research 
funding but were not deemed grounds for panel ineligibility. At the start of each meeting, the 
WHO Secretariat described the DOI process and GDG members were asked to verbally update 
any other DOI; no verbal conflicts were declared. Web searches did not identify any additional 
interests that would likely affect members' independence.

4 Recommendations for patients with non-
severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral 
diseases 
In many settings, patients with symptoms that are common to co-circulating arboviral 
diseases will present to clinicians who often do not have access to reliable diagnostic tests, 
including those conducted at point of care, to differentiate between them. Thus, despite the 
differences in pathophysiology between arboviral infections and diseases, clinicians are often 
managing patients without certainty of the aetiology.  (43,44).  The interventions thus need to 
be considered in terms of benefits and harms across the arboviral diseases included in the 
differential diagnosis. 
4.1 Oral rehydration 
Conditional recommendation for 
WHO suggests the use of protocolized oral fluid treatment compared with non-
protocolized oral fluid treatment in patients with suspected or confirmed non- severe 
arboviral disease. [Conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence]. 
• Monitoring of hydration, and prevention of dehydration, should be performed in all 
patients. Clinicians should provide a cup or other means of measuring oral intake 
and give advice on how to record the amount taken. 
• Volumes of fluids to be administered will depend on age (children vs adults) and 
underlying medical conditions (e.g. congestive heart failure, chronic kidney 
disease). 
4.1.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms 
Benefits: In patients with non-severe disease, documenting the use of protocolized oral liquid 
intake may reduce hospital admission (22 fewer hospital admissions per 1000, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 38 fewer to 15 more). 
Harms: Specific groups with known intolerance to fluids (for example those with chronic 
kidney disease or chronic cardiac disease) may be more at risk of the harms from fluid. 
  
Recommendations for patients with non-severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral diseases 
 25 
Certainty of the evidence 
Research evidence was limited to dengue. This evidence was indirectly applied to other 
arboviral infections.  
A single RCT involved a patient population inferred to be non-severe. This population included 
53.8% confirmed dengue cases, 11.2% probable dengue fever cases, 24.3% cases of other 
febrile illnesses and 10.5% undetermined cases. The evidence for non-dengue arbovirus 
infection was indirect. 
Values and preferences 
An overall summary of expected values and preferences is given in section 3.2.3. Given the 
possible benefits and minimal harms associated with the intervention in most patients, the 
GDG felt that most patients with non-severe disease would choose to use protocolized oral 
fluid treatment. 
Resources and other considerations 
Equity: The simplicity of the intervention is likely to promote accessible and equitability. 
Acceptability: The intervention was simple and non-invasive, and therefore likely to be 
acceptable. 
Feasibility: The potential positive impact of an intervention early in the treatment pathway 
was felt to be high. 
The GDG concurred that the intervention would be expected to have similar benefits in 
pregnant women and children and that the recommendation should apply to these groups. 
4.1.2 Justification 
During dengue, chikungunya, and Zika outbreaks, this patient population is important 
because of the high proportion of individuals presenting with non-severe disease. This has 
substantial public health implications, especially when hospital services may be 
overwhelmed. The recommendation applies to patients who do not require intravenous fluid 
resuscitation for shock and dehydration treatment. 
The GDG concluded that the balance of benefits and harms would favour the intervention, as 
the risks of over-hydration through oral fluids would be low, monitoring of intake would 
enable more careful fluid balance, and patients would typically take less fluid than would be 
optimal if not using protocolized oral fluid treatment. 
The type of fluid was not specified in the RCT contributing data-to-evidence summary. The 
mean 24-hour fluid intake was 2500 ml in the control group and 3,000 ml in the intervention 
group. Both intervention and control groups were told to optimize their hydration (take five 
cups). The intervention provided, additionally: 
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
26 
• A means of measuring volume and administering fluid (a 200 ml cup). 
• Advice on recording the volume administered. 
Although the data are predominantly from patients with dengue, the GDG noted that in early 
disease, differentiation would be very difficult or impossible and concluded that the risk: 
benefit considerations would apply similarly to other arboviral infections. 
4.1.3 Practical information 
• When oral hydration is possible, it is preferred over infusion of intravenous fluids (45). 
When oral fluids are prescribed, they must be taken in sufficient amounts to address 
the fluid deficit and ongoing needs. (See Table 4.1 for a summary of findings.) 
• To replace fluid loss from fever and vomiting, encourage frequent small amounts of 
oral fluids, especially for those experiencing nausea and anorexia. 
• Record and review oral fluid intake daily in an ambulatory setting. Provide a cup or 
other means of measuring volume to ensure accurate fluid intake. Advise patients and 
caregivers to record the volume of fluids administered by noting the amount given 
each time and totalling it at the end of the day. Review this record daily to ensure 
adequate hydration.  
• Adequate oral fluid intake should result in urination at least four to six times per day. 
Patients should aim for this threshold and monitor their urination frequency. If they 
notice any significant deviations from this pattern, they should promptly contact their 
health care provider for further guidance. 
• Water should always be the main source of fluids. Choose fluids based on availability 
and ensure they come from a safe source of drinking water. For more information on 
fluid selection, please refer to other WHO guidelines (46). 
• Using standardised oral rehydration solution is a practical way of ensuring appropriate 
electrolyte replacement. In the absence of ORS, other fluids as locally available may be 
used in addition to water, including soups, unsweetened fluid juice, coconut water, 
yogurt drinks, and water used after cooking of rice or grains. 
• Avoid commercial carbonated drinks that exceed the isotonic level (5% sugar) as they 
may exacerbate hyperglycaemia related to physiological stress from dengue and 
diabetes mellitus. Examples include commercial carbonated beverages, commercial 
fruit juices and sweetened tea (5,45).  
• For more detailed information on fluid therapy, please refer to other WHO guidelines 
(45).

4.2 Symptom control 
Pain and fever are common symptoms across all four arboviral infections. Effective 
management of these symptoms is important for ensuring patient wellbeing/comfort.  
4.2.1 Paracetamol/acetaminophen 
Conditional recommendation for 
WHO suggests the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) for the treatment of pain and/or 
fever in patients with suspected or confirmed non-severe arboviral disease. [Conditional 
recommendation, low-certainty evidence] 
• This recommendation does not apply to yellow fever 
• Use paracetamol (acetaminophen) with caution in patients with pre-existing or 
newly developing liver disease or transaminitis.  
 
4.2.1.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms 
Benefits: The absolute benefit of paracetamol was not assessed; the panel examined 
comparative data between alternative therapies. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) probably has 
little or no impact on length of hospital stay (0.1 fewer days of length of stay, 95% CI 1.11 
fewer days to 0.91 more days). It may be less efficacious in fever reduction than NSAIDs from 
indirect population (children with undifferentiated fever), low-certainty evidence. 
Harms: In patients with non-severe disease, it is uncertain whether paracetamol 
(acetaminophen) increases or decreases severe bleeding and acute kidney injury. There was 
very low certainty evidence for liver failure as inferred from elevated liver enzymes resulting 
from paracetamol (192 more cases than standard care, 95% CI 4 more to 716 more), and 
possibly little or no impact on duration of illness (0.2 more days of duration of illness, 95% CI 
0.2 fewer to 0.6 more). 
Certainty of the evidence 
Research evidence was limited to dengue. This evidence was indirectly applied to other 
arboviral infections. 
A single RCT assessed length of hospital stay in 123 dengue patients (moderate certainty, 
downgraded for serious imprecision). Based on data from 587 participants in 5 studies, 
paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be less efficacious in reducing fever than NSAIDs (low 
certainty due to imprecision and indirectness in applying evidence from children younger 
than 2 years old with fever from various causes). 
Recommendations for patients with non-severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral diseases 
 29 
A single small study with 89 subjects provided very low certainty for adverse events related to 
paracetamol- (acetaminophen) related severe bleeding and acute kidney injury. 
RCT evidence from 88 participants in one study provided very low certainty of evidence that 
paracetamol (acetaminophen) might elevate liver enzymes compared with standard of care 
(RR 2.92, 95% CI 1.04-8.16, serious imprecision, and very serious indirectness). Evidence from 
one RCT (n=123) with a follow-up period of seven days suggested there was probably little to 
no impact of paracetamol on duration of symptoms (moderate certainty due to serious 
imprecision). 
Values and preferences 
An overall summary of expected values and preferences is given in section 3.2.3. The GDG 
considered patients would choose to use a medication for pain and fever. Given the 
alternatives, patients might choose paracetamol as a treatment due to its accessibility. 
Resources and other considerations 
Equity and acceptability: No equity, availability or cost issues were identified, as paracetamol 
(acetaminophen) is widely available at low cost. 
Feasibility: Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is included on the WHO Essential Medicines List 
(47). 
4.2.1.2 Justification 
The overall body of evidence for paracetamol (acetaminophen) was considered of moderate 
to very low certainty, primarily due to imprecision and indirectness. The panel considered 
that paracetamol might not increase the risk of severe bleeding or acute kidney injury when 
given at recommended doses, although it may elevate liver enzymes. Mild rises in liver 
function tests in dengue may not indicate significant liver injury, and a holistic assessment 
should guide the choice of analgesia. The GDG inferred that paracetamol (acetaminophen) 
had few safety concerns when used for the symptomatic control of pain and fever. The panel 
noted that at the point of presentation, it might be impossible to distinguish between dengue 
and other arboviral diseases and that the potential for harm related to platelet inhibition 
caused by NSAIDs made paracetamol (acetaminophen) a safer alternative, despite low 
certainty evidence that it might be less effective.

4.2.1.3 Practical info 
Mechanism of action 
Understanding of the mechanism of action of paracetamol (acetaminophen) remains 
incomplete but appears to be derived mostly from action on the central nervous system. 
Hypotheses include: 1) inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme because its analgesic 
and antipyretic effects are similar to those of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (without 
anti-inflammatory anti-coagulation effects); 2) inhibition of the L-arginine-nitric oxide 
pathway and reinforcement of descending inhibitory serotonergic pain pathways; and 3) 
effect on cannabinoid receptors by active metabolites. 
Potential indications and contraindications in arboviral infection 
Pain and fever. 
Route, dosage, and duration 
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is given orally as a dose, based on age and body weight, as 
below in Table 4.2. It is available in tablets of 500 mg and as oral powder for reconstitution 
and oral suspension. Indirect evidence from multiple systematic reviews shows it to be 
effective for pain (except for chronic lower back pain), and adverse events are not significantly 
higher than in placebo (48). 
Table 4-2. Dosing of Paracetamol (acetaminophen) for treatment 
Age Body weight Dose and duration for non/severe, suspected or 
confirmed, arboviral diseases 
Adults > 50 kg 500 mg – 1 g every 4-6 hours (maximum daily dose: 4 g) 
Paediatrics 10-15mg/kg every 4-6 hours (maximum daily dose: 60 mg/kg) 
 
Do not repeat the dose more frequently than every 4 hours. 
Maximum daily dose to avoid hepatic toxicity is based on all routes of administration and all 
products containing paracetamol (acetaminophen) (49). 
Dose adjustment 
Renal impairment: It is recommended when giving paracetamol to patients with renal 
impairment, to reduce the dose and to increase the minimum interval between each 
administration to at least 6 hours unless directed otherwise by a physician (49), as below in 
Table 4.3. 
  
Recommendations for patients with non-severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral diseases 
 31

Glomerular filtration rate Dose 
10-50 ml/min 500 mg every 6 hours 
<10 ml/min 500 mg every 8 hours 
 
Hepatic impairment: Reduce the dose or prolong the dosing interval in patients with hepatic 
impairment or Gilbert's Syndrome; the daily dose should not exceed 2g/day unless directed 
by a physician (49). These doses should not be repeated more frequently than every four to six 
hours nor should more than four doses be given in any 24-hour period. 
Other considerations 
Children: Children should not be given paracetamol (acetaminophen) for more than three 
days without consulting a doctor (49). 
Pregnancy: A large amount of data on pregnant women indicates neither malformative nor 
foetal /neonatal toxicity. Epidemiological studies on neurodevelopment in children exposed 
to paracetamol in utero show inconclusive results. If clinically needed, use paracetamol 
during pregnancy at the lowest effective dose, for the shortest possible time and at the lowest 
possible frequency. 
Breastfeeding: Following oral administration, small amounts of paracetamol are excreted into 
breast milk. However, these are not clinically significant. To date, there are no known 
undesirable effects or side effects during breast-feeding. Paracetamol can be administered 
during lactation at therapeutic doses.

4.2.2 Metamizole/dipyrone 
Conditional recommendation for 
WHO suggests the use of metamizole (dipyrone) for the treatment of pain and/or fever 
in patients with suspected or confirmed non-severe arboviral disease. [Conditional 
recommendation, low certainty evidence] 
• Metamizole has limited geographic availability and regulatory approval. 
 
4.2.2.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms 
Benefits: Metamizole (dipyrone) causes similar fever reduction to NSAIDs (moderate certainty 
due to the indirectness of the patient population); in children with undifferentiated fever the 
effect is 0.03°C lower temperature, 95% CI 0.29°C lower to 0.24°C higher. It is uncertain 
whether metamizole (dipyrone) improves symptom control; 52 more patients improved with 
the intervention, 95% CI 151 fewer to 335 more. 
Harms: Metamizole (dipyrone) probably has little or no impact on aplastic anaemia 
(1/1,000,000 fewer cases, 95% CI 3 fewer to 23 more, low certainty) compared with a baseline 
estimate of 3 per million cases of aplastic anaemia (0.5 per million of agranulocytosis). These 
data derive from a review of available evidence of effect in the largest published multicentre 
study in three Latin American countries, where researchers initially conducted a broad active 
search for cases from April 2002-April 2003 to determine background population incidence of 
agranulocytosis and aplastic anaemia, and then a multicentre case-control study in defined 
research sited to identify incident cases and risk factors for their development (50,51). In 
patients with non-severe, suspected or confirmed arboviral disease, it is very uncertain 
whether metamizole (dipyrone) increases severe bleeding (3 more severe bleeding cases, 
95% CI 3 fewer to 23 more). 
Certainty of the evidence 
Research evidence was limited to dengue. This evidence was indirectly applied to other 
arboviral infections.  
The certainty of evidence for improvement in symptom control was also rated as very low, 
supported by one observational study with serious risk of bias and serious imprecision. 
However, the certainty of evidence for improvement of fever was rated as moderate. This 
rating was supported by three RCTs identified as indirect evidence, based on comparisons 
with the use of NSAIDs in young children with fever from any cause, and imprecision.  
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
34 
A systematic review of the rates of bone marrow suppression was not performed, and the GDG 
noted multiple different estimates exist. The GDG considered one large observational study, 
with the certainty of evidence for agranulocytosis was rated as low due to risk of bias and 
indirect evidence from patients without arboviral disease. However, there was high certainty 
in a very low baseline risk. 
Based on three non-RCTs involving 1568 participants, the certainty of evidence for severe 
bleeding was rated as very low. This downgrade was due to inappropriate adjustments for 
potential confounders, resulting in a very serious risk of bias and serious imprecision. 
The GDG concluded that metamizole (dipyrone) might not be associated with major 
complications such as agranulocytosis and severe bleeding. The evidence suggested its effect 
on fever was comparable to that of NSAIDs. 
Values and preferences 
Applying the agreed upon values and preferences (see 3.2.3) for patients with non-severe 
disease, the GDG inferred that most patients would use metamizole if there was good 
evidence of symptomatic benefit.  
Resources and other considerations 
Metamizole (dipyrone) is not included on the WHO Essential Medicines List (47). Metamizole 
has limited geographic availability and licencing. Concerns about the safety of metamizole 
(dipyrone), particularly with respect to inducing agranulocytosis, prompted market 
withdrawals in several countries over the past four decades including the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, the United States, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, 
and more recently, India. Metamizole remains readily available in Spain, Russia, Israel, and 
many countries in Latin America; in Germany access to the medication was restricted from 
over-the-counter to requiring a medical prescription. Primary research studies and meta-
analyses have yielded a wide range of estimates of incidence of metamizole induced 
agranulocytosis, from 1.5-40 times more common when used vs not, and some authors 
concluded that there was no meaningful difference in overall rates of adverse events when 
compared with other widely used analgesics (52,53). 
4.2.2.2 Justification 
Research evidence was derived only from studies addressing patients with dengue. The GDG 
did not feel this indirectness was significant enough to rate down. 
The panel noted that metamizole (dipyrone) may not increase the risk of severe bleeding or 
agranulocytosis. For aplastic anaemia, the baseline risk estimate was derived from 
observational studies in Latin America (where metamizole is widely used) was found to be 3 
Recommendations for patients with non-severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral diseases 
 35 
cases per 1 million (50). The panel recognised different regulatory approaches to metamizole, 
as above.  
They inferred that its effect on fever is similar to NSAIDs in patients with non-severe arboviral 
disease. Therefore, the panel considered metamizole (dipyrone) as an alternative to 
paracetamol in countries where it is approved for the symptomatic control of pain and fever in 
patients with non-severe, suspected or confirmed arboviral disease. 
4.2.2.3 Practical info 
Mechanism of action 
Metamizole (dipyrone) is classified as an atypical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and is 
used as an antipyretic and analgesic. It has lower anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic 
activity than conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Research suggests that 
metamizole (dipyrone) inhibits COX-3 with a higher affinity compared to COX-1 or COX-2. 
Special considerations and adverse events related to metamizole (dipyrone) 
Health care providers should inform patients about both the benefits and potential side 
effects, such as agranulocytosis, during the clinical decision-making process to help them 
make informed choices regarding their treatment plan. The choice of this medication depends 
on local epidemiology and resources, including availability and monitoring facilities. 
Route, dosage, and duration 
Metamizole (dipyrone) is given orally at a dose based on age and body weight, as below in 
Table 4.5. It is available as a tablet of 500 mg and as oral powder for reconstitution and oral 
suspension. Other routes of administration are available.

Dose adjustment 
Renal and hepatic impairment: Avoid multiple high doses when renal or hepatic function is 
impaired, as the elimination rate is reduced. To date, there has been insufficient experience 
with long-term use of metamizole (dipyrone) in patients with severe hepatic and renal 
impairment. 
Other considerations 
Children: For children and adolescents up to 14 years of age 8–16 mg metamizole (dipyrone) 
per kg body weight can be given as a single dose. A dose of 10 mg/kg body weight is suggested 
for fever. This single dose can be taken up to 4 times daily at intervals of 6–8 hours. Age-
appropriate formulations (oral drops, solution for injection) are available. 
Pregnancy: Although data are limited, no evidence shows teratogenic or embryotoxic effects 
of metamizole (dipyrone) when used during the first trimester. However, evidence indicates 
fetotoxicity, such as foetal renal impairment and ductus arteriosus constriction, when used in 
the third trimester. Therefore, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) considers metamizole 
contraindicated during the third trimester (55,56). 
Breastfeeding: Avoid using metamizole during breastfeeding because the relative infant dose 
may be high, and the overall evidence is scarce. Use of better investigated and characterized 
analgesics is advised (56).

4.2.3 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
Strong recommendation against 
WHO recommends against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications 
(NSAIDs) in patients with acute suspected or confirmed arboviral disease, irrespective of 
severity. [Strong recommendation, low certainty evidence] 
• For patients on established NSAID therapy (for example for ischaemic heart disease 
or inflammatory arthropathies), the decision to continue should be made according 
to anticipated risk/benefit balance. 
• The recommendation does not apply in confirmed chikungunya and confirmed Zika 
where NSAID treatment may be considered for arthralgia and inflammation. 
 
4.2.3.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms 
Benefits: NSAIDs probably improve fever compared with standard of care (0.45°C lower 
temperature, 95% CI 1°C lower to 0.11°C more, moderate certainty). 
Harms: Whether NSAIDs treatment increases severe bleeding in patients with non-severe 
arbovirus disease is uncertain (1 more case per 1000 patients, 95% CI 1 fewer to 3 more, very 
low certainty). It is uncertain whether NSAIDs increases blood product requirement (2 more, 
95% CI 2 fewer to 12 more, very low certainty). 
Certainty of the evidence 
Research evidence was limited to dengue. This evidence was indirectly applied to other 
arboviral infections. 
There was moderate certainty in the evidence for fever improvement (0.45°C fewer 
temperature than standard care) based on two studies with 287 patients with respiratory viral 
infections, with consideration for indirect evidence (as the studies did not involve patients 
with arbovirus disease) and imprecision. 
Four non-RCTs involving patients with arbovirus disease were identified. Additionally, three 
RCTs with 34 participants and one non-RCT with 2285 participants provided indirect evidence 
based on bleeding in haemophilic patients. There were several sources of bias in the studies, 
including indirectness (the RCTs did not involve patients with arbovirus disease) and the lack 
of adjustment for confounding variables in the non-RCTs. 
Recommendations for patients with non-severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral diseases 
 39 
A single non-RCT with 642 participants evaluated blood product requirement. The certainty of 
evidence was rated down from low (observational data) to very low due to inappropriate 
adjustment for potential confounders. 
Values and preferences 
Applying the agreed-upon values and preferences (see 3.2.3), for patients with non-severe 
disease, the GDG inferred that most patients suffering from a non-severe disease, given its 
good prognosis, would be reluctant to use NSAIDs with concerns of harm where there were 
alternative treatment options. 
The GDG considered that patients would choose to avoid NSAID treatment as a precaution 
against the potential risks related to bleeding which although low and uncertain in frequency , 
could be very severe if they did occur. 
Resources and other considerations 
None noted. 
4.2.3.2 Justification 
The GDG panel decided that despite the very low certainty of the evidence, there were strong 
concerns around the possibility that NSAIDs, through their anti-platelet action, could 
contribute to mortality in dengue resulting from severe bleeding. 
The panel reasoned that in many circumstances during the acute presentation, differentiation 
of the causative aetiology would not be possible. At the time of prescription, therefore, unless 
dengue could be ruled out, there would be safer alternatives available (paracetamol and 
metamizole). Despite the low certainty evidence, the panel issued a strong recommendation 
on the basis of similar benefits but fewer risks according to rationale outlined in the GRADE 
framework (38,57). 
For those patients already taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications for their anti-
platelet effect - for example, those receiving aspirin for coronary heart disease - the GDG 
noted that risk and benefits would need to be assessed on an individual basis. 
The panel acknowledged that where the aetiology is known, clinicians might use NSAIDs, for 
example in the inflammatory arthralgia and arthritis caused by chikungunya.

4.2.3.3 Practical information 
Mechanism of action 
NSAIDs include drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, ketorolac, indomethacin, naproxen, and others, 
which influence the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase (COX) responsible for producing prostaglandins.  
At least two isoforms of COX enzymes exist, coded by separate genes. The constitutive isoform 
(COX-1) has multiple actions, including, for example, the production of prostacyclin, which 
has a cytoprotective effect on the gastric mucosa. 
The inducible isoform (COX-2) is upregulated and produced in response to inflammatory 
stimuli and cytokines in migratory and other cells. 
Effect on platelets: Aspirin and other NSAIDs inhibit platelet activation, aggregation, and 
secretion by reducing the production of thromboxane A2 (TxA2).

4.3 Corticosteroids (for non-severe arboviral disease) 
Conditional recommendation against 
WHO suggests against using corticosteroid treatment in patients with acute suspected 
or confirmed non-severe arboviral disease. [Conditional recommendation, low certainty 
evidence] 
• For patients on established corticosteroid therapy, the decision to continue should 
be made according to anticipated risk: benefit balance. 
 
4.3.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms 
Benefits: There was very low certainty of evidence of any benefit of corticosteroids in non-
severe arboviral disease (18 fewer hospital admissions, 95% CI 35 fewer to 18 more). 
Harms: Corticosteroids probably have little or no impact on gastrointestinal bleeding. It is 
uncertain if they cause severe bleeding.  
Certainty of the evidence 
A single randomized trial assessed corticosteroid use in 179 dengue outpatients, but only 
hospital admission could be extracted from the systematic review publication, with very low 
certainty of evidence. 
Indirect data on adverse events in participants without arboviral diseases provided data from 
245 participants in two randomized controlled trials and for gastrointestinal bleeding, from 33 
253 participants in 159 randomized controlled trials (moderate certainty of no effect) and 
severe bleeding (very low certainty due to serious imprecision). The median duration of 
corticosteroid treatment was 8.5 days (IQR 3.3–28.0), and the appreciation that short and 
longer course of steroids might have different adverse events contributed to the very low 
certainty rating. 
Values and preferences 
Applying the agreed upon values and preferences (see 3.2.3), for patients with non-severe 
disease, the GDG inferred that most patients, given their good prognosis, would be reluctant 
to use corticosteroids when it is uncertain if they would receive an overall benefit.  
  
Recommendations for patients with non-severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral diseases 
 43 
Resources and other considerations 
Corticosteroids are widely available at low cost worldwide, particularly oral preparations. 
Multiple corticosteroids are included on the WHO Essential Medicines List (47), such as 
dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and prednisolone. 
4.3.2 Justification 
Due to the very low certainty of evidence, and acknowledging the lack of direct research 
findings to inform them, the panel argued that the principle of non-maleficence would justify 
a recommendation against the use of corticosteroids. 
Two panel members felt that a recommendation should be a “strongly against,” specifically 
for dengue based on the putative harm of immunosuppression in acute infectious disease; a 
conditional recommendation was made on consensus with these concerns noted. 
For patients already on corticosteroid therapy at the time of infection, an individualized 
clinical determination of the risk and benefit balance is required. 
The panel intended that this recommendation apply to chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever 
and Zika. The GDG noted that compared to dengue, other arboviral infections (e.g. 
chikungunya and yellow fever) may be more frequently associated with complications such as 
uveitis, myocarditis, or severe pruritus, for which the use of corticosteroids may be indicated, 
although patients with these complications would more likely be classified as having severe 
disease. 
4.3.3 Practical information  
Mechanism of action 
Corticosteroids bind glucocorticoid receptors mediating changes in gene expression that lead 
to multiple downstream effects over hours to days. Non-genomic effects through interactions 
between the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor or a membrane-bound glucocorticoid 
receptor can result in changes in shorter timeframes. 
Corticosteroids have very broad activity, including alteration of immune cell function such as 
reducing neutrophil apoptosis and demargination; reduction of arachidonic acid derivatives 
through inhibition of phospholipase A2; inhibition of transcription factors such as NF-κB and 
AP-1, with multiple subsequent changes in gene expression; and promotion of anti-
inflammatory genes such as interleukin-10. 
Lower doses of corticosteroids tend to have an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses 
are more profoundly immunosuppressive, for example inhibiting the production of B cells and 
T cells (58). The short-term effects of corticosteroids are decreased vasodilation and 
permeability of capillaries, as well as decreased leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation. 
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
44 
Corticosteroids also exhibit mineralocorticoid activity, impacting water, salt, and mineral 
homeostasis. 
Adverse event profile 
Adverse effects due to corticosteroids are dose and duration dependent and affect multiple 
body systems. The incidence and severity of adverse events are also affected by patient age, 
underlying medical conditions (such as diabetes mellitus) and concomitant medication use. A 
systematic review of 22 RCTs in children who received ≤14 days of systemic corticosteroids 
published in 2016 described vomiting, behavioural changes, and sleep disturbances as the 
most common adverse events reported, and increased susceptibility to infection as the most 
serious (59). Although not measured in all patients, 43 of 53 patients demonstrated 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression.  
In adults treated with ≤ 30 days of corticosteroids, the most common adverse events noted in 
a large retrospective cohort and self-controlled case series in the United States included 
sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fracture (60).

5 Recommendations specific to patients with 
severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral 
disease (hospitalized) 
Clinical management should be based on the suspected aetiology and the patient’s needs. For 
a definition of severe disease used in this guideline, refer to section 2.6.  
The approach to treat severe cases must involve thorough training of health care personnel. 
Practices may differ among regions, but standardization of procedures in hospitalized 
patients is the best option to ensure consistent and effective care. 
Users of the guideline are strongly encouraged to educate patients to recognize warning signs 
and present to a health care facility quickly if they occur.  
5.1 Choice of intravenous fluid 
Conditional recommendation for 
WHO suggests using crystalloid fluid rather than colloid fluid in patients who require 
intravenous fluid treatment for suspected or confirmed severe arboviral disease. 
[Conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence] 
• Clinicians must personalise treatment decisions due to complex fluid and 
resuscitation requirements, and the dynamic nature of severe arboviral disease. 
This applies particularly to choices of fluid subsequent to the initial resuscitation. 
 
5.1.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms 
Benefits: In patients with severe, suspected, or confirmed arboviral disease requiring 
hospitalization, colloids may have little to no impact on mortality (no difference between the 
two intervention groups, 95% CI 24 fewer to 24 more). There was low certainty evidence that 
compared with crystalloids, colloids did not have impact on organ failure (2 fewer cases of 
organ failure per 1000 patients, 95% CI 17 fewer to 22 more), or on clinical bleeding, defined as 
mucosal or major soft-tissue bleeding (3 more cases of bleeding per 1000 patients, 95% CI 15 
fewer to 53 more). Colloids probably have little to no impact on hospital length of stay (no 
difference between the two intervention groups, 95% CI 0.47 fewer to 0.47 more). 
  
Recommendations specific to patients with severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral disease (hospitalized) 
 47 
Harms: Colloids may increase severe adverse events, such as infusion reactions (27 more 
cases of severe adverse events, 95% CI 1 more to 180 more). Adverse events associated with 
colloid (dextran) were typified by rigors and temperature usually occurring within 6 hours of 
starting the study fluid. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Research evidence was limited to dengue. This evidence was indirectly applied to other 
arboviral infections.  
Three RCTs involving 313 participants evaluated mortality and organ failure among children 
with dengue receiving intravenous fluid infusion, providing low certainty evidence due to 
serious imprecision (the confidence interval includes both important benefits and harms).  
A single RCT of 383 participants evaluated clinical bleeding in children with dengue (low 
certainty due to serious imprecision).  
The certainty of the evidence for the length of hospital stay is rated moderate due to serious 
risk of bias. Children with dengue receiving intravenous fluid infusion had a similar average 
hospital stay of four days, regardless of whether they were treated with crystalloids or 
colloids. 
Three studies involving 658 children with dengue evaluated serious adverse events. The 
certainty of the evidence is rated low due to serious imprecision, as all events occurred in the 
intervention group, not in the control group. Absolute effect estimates were 27 more cases of 
severe adverse events per 1000 patients in the colloid group compared to the crystalloid 
group (95% CI 1 more to 180 more). 
Values and preferences 
Applying the agreed-upon values and preferences (see 3.2.3) for severe disease, the GDG 
inferred that most patients, given the uncertain benefits of colloids and the possibility of 
harms, would choose to receive crystalloids.  
Resources and other considerations 
Equity: Colloids are more expensive than crystalloids, although the panel had insufficient 
quantitative information, and believed that a single universal estimate would not apply to all 
regions. Equity concerns arose about colloids because of increased costs. 
Acceptability: The intervention was judged as likely to be acceptable. 
Feasibility: Crystalloids are frequently more available than colloids. 
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
48 
5.1.2 Justification 
Research evidence was limited to dengue. This evidence was indirectly applied to other 
arboviral infections. All studies were conducted on hospitalized children, encompassing the 
following number of patients.  
The preference for crystalloids was driven mostly based on the higher rate of severe adverse 
events with colloids, and the absence of evidence of benefit. The GDG panel appreciated the 
heterogeneity of colloid interventions which were tested, and that there would be situations 
where the initial choice of one intravenous fluid might be changed for a different fluid later, 
driven by individualized patient-clinician decisions.

Gelatins (gelafusine 3% and 4% variously) 2 207

Albumin 0 0 
The GDG judged that the recommendation should apply similarly to adults, during pregnancy, 
and to children. Similarly, that the recommendation would also apply to arboviral diseases 
other than dengue.

5.2 Guiding the administration of intravenous fluid volume 
The purpose of fluid resuscitation in shock is to improve oxygen delivery to vital organs. 
Briefly, shock may be hypovolemic (loss of intravascular volume, with resulting low cardiac 
preload), distributive (pathological reduction in systemic vascular resistance due to 
vasodilatation), cardiogenic (reduction of systolic or diastolic cardiac function), obstructive 
(physical obstruction of the great vessels or the heart, either internally within the vessels 
themselves or through extrinsic compression). (63,64) 
Dengue and plasma leakage 
Some patients with dengue experience a clinically significant degree of plasma leakage due to 
increased vascular permeability, which manifests as fluid accumulation and intravascular 
fluid depletion, during the critical phase. This typically occurs around day 4–6 of illness and 
often coinciding with defervescence(65). This phase typically improves spontaneously after 
48–72 hours (66). 
Differences in management between arboviruses 
Pathophysiological differences between a rboviral diseases require adaptation of clinical 
approaches. For example, plasma leakage in dengue may be profound and require significant 
initial volumes of intravenous fluid , with subsequent de-escalation to minimise accumulation 
of interstitial fluid. In contrast, chikungunya can lead to myocarditis and cardiac insufficiency , 
especially in infants and older adults , making iatrogenic pulmonary oedema more likely ; 
although myocarditis can occur in dengue, th is is rare in comparison with the rate of dengue 
related shock. In each case, monitoring of the effect of intravenous fluid administration should 
be performed to maximise benefit and minimise harm. 
Patient monitoring 
Routine patient monitoring for fluid balance includes regular and frequent monitoring of 
physiological variables, urine output, and laboratory values (notably haematocrit) (5). Clinical 
measures of response include blood pressure (including pulse pressure and mean arterial 
pressure), heart rate, urine output and mental status. Imminent or worsening respiratory 
compromise, such as pulmonary oedema, may be detected by rising respiratory rate and/or 
decreasing oxygen saturation.  
Fluids should be given to improve targets of perfusion, at volumes and rates which may be 
modified based on age, weight, clinical and biological conditions (such as acid-base balance) 
and concomitant therapy. Careful monitoring is essential.

5.2.2 Capillary refill time 
Strong recommendation for 
WHO recommends the use of capillary refill time to guide intravenous fluid management in 
patients with suspected or confirmed arboviral disease in addition to standard 
care/monitoring. [Strong recommendation, low certainty evidence] 
 
5.2.2.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms 
Benefits: From two RCTs involving a total of 466 participants, there was high-certainty 
evidence that capillary refill time (CRT)-guided resuscitation did not increase mortality 
compared to lactate-guided resuscitation (2 fewer deaths per 1000 patients than lactate; 
95% CI 6 fewer to 2 more). 
Harms: In one RCT involving 30 participants, fluid replenishment was guided using fluid 
challenges followed by reassessment. Peripheral perfusion was monitored using CRT and 
other parameters. This approach was compared to a standard care group where fluid 
administration followed fixed clinical guidelines. The outcomes on mortality (3 more deaths 
per 1000 patients than standard care; 95% CI 10 fewer to 33 more), hospital length of stay (27 
fewer days than standard care; 95% CI 43 fewer to 11 more) and intensive care unit (ICU) 
length of stay (2 more days than standard care; 95% CI: 1.5 fewer to 5.5 more) were uncertain 
due to very low certainty of evidence. 
Certainty of the evidence  
Evidence for CRT with standard care-guided resuscitation was very low certainty due to 
extremely serious imprecision and indirectness (it was based on a single RCT involving 30 
participants with sepsis). For hospital and ICU lengths of stay, certainty was also very low, 
with additional concerns of serious risk of measurement bias.  
By contrast, high certainty evidence informed comparisons of CRT with lactate-guided 
resuscitation (two RCTs involving over 400 participants). The panel noted concerns about 
indirectness from sepsis patients but felt the monitoring aspects of circulatory compromise 
were similar in dengue. The certainty of evidence for renal replacement therapy is rated 
moderate due to indirectness and imprecision, as the 95% CI includes significant benefits. The 
certainty of evidence for hospital length of stay is rated very low due to indirectness, potential 
performance and detection biases, resulting in a serious risk of bias and very serious 
imprecision, as the 95% CI includes both significant benefits and harms. For ICU length of stay 
certainty was low due to potential measurement bias, indirectness, and imprecision. 
Recommendations specific to patients with severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral disease (hospitalized) 
 53 
Values and preferences 
Applying the agreed-upon values and preferences (see 3.2.3) for patients with severe disease, 
the GDG inferred that most patients, given the possible benefit and lack of harm, would 
choose to have capillary refill time measured to guide intravenous fluid management.  
Resources and other considerations 
Equity, acceptability, and feasibility: The panel expected that the use of CRT would require 
training to ensure the correct methods of measurement and interpretation. However, the use 
of a simple, widely available, and low-cost intervention would be feasible and increase equity. 
The GDG concluded that this recommendation would apply to all arboviral diseases. 
The GDG judged that the recommendation would apply similarly in pregnancy and in children. 
5.2.2.2 Justification 
The GDG considered evidence comparing CRT with the standard of care, and CRT with lactate 
levels. Based on strong evidence of superiority of lactate monitoring over standard care, see 
5.2.2 lactate, and high certainty evidence of non-inferiority of CRT versus lactate in terms of 
mortality, the GDG panel recommends measuring CRT over not measuring CRT to guide 
intravenous fluid resuscitation. 
The panel emphasized the importance of contextualizing CRT results for each patient and 
ensuring that health care personnel are adequately trained in both performing the test and 
interpreting its results. 
5.2.2.3 Practical info 
What is capillary refill time (CRT)? 
CRT is an accessible marker of end organ perfusion. It measures the time for blood to return to 
the skin capillaries after they have been emptied by applying pressure. It is quick, visual, and 
non-invasive test (41), although education of health care workers is paramount to ensure 
correct measurement and interpretation. It is used for recognition of hypoperfusion and for 
monitoring of fluid administration. Detailed guidelines from there are available from 
WHO(68,69). 
What factors affect CRT? 
CRT can be affected by multiple factors, including room temperature, skin temperature, age, 
sex, room lighting, procedural technique, presence of underlying vascular disease, and the 
site of testing. Variability can be minimized through training, education, and standardized 
protocols to mitigate the impact of ambient factors (67,70).  
  
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
54 
CRT standardization protocol 
Standardized procedures can enhance reliability and reduce interobserver variability (Figure 
5.1). To reflect the procedure in the research studies, in infants, children and adults: 
• Check the environment: 
o Ensure a warm room. 
o Choose a site free from skin abnormalities. 
o Place the patient’s hand at the level of the thorax / heart. 
• Apply firm pressure to the ventral surface of the distal phalanx of the index finger for 10 
seconds. 
• Remove the pressure. 
• Measure the time for the return of pre-existing skin colour. 
• Use a chronometer (71). 
• A CRT longer than 3 seconds should be considered abnormal. (70,72) 
A microscope slide was used to apply pressure in the RCTs as this enables visualisation of skin 
blanching and ensures even pressure. The GDG panel recognized that usual clinical 
practice does not require a glass slide.  
Figure 5-1. Suggested way to measure standardized capillary refill time (67) 
 
Notes: 1 – Place the patient’s hand at the level of their heart (mid chest). 2 – Apply firm pressure to the 
ventral surface of the distal phalanx of one finger for 10 seconds. This can be done using your thumb, or if 
available a glass microscope slide so that blanching of the skin underneath can be confirmed. 3 – Release 
the pressure and measure the time taken for the skin colour to return to the same as before.

a. Fluid repletion was guided using intravenous fluid challenge and subsequent re-evaluation of peripheral perfusion 
to assess the further need of fluid challenges. Capillary refill time, the peripheral perfusion index, the forearm-to-
fingertip body temperature gradient, and the tissue oxygenation saturation were measured. Only patients with 
“poor peripheral perfusion” (i.e., three of four parameters altered) were considered suitable for fluid repletion. The 
intervention also included fluid targeted to a minimum cardiac index of 2.5 L/min/m2, irrespective of peripheral 
perfusion and a minimum mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg. 
b. Fluid repletion was guided using fluid challenges and after challenge, stroke volume was re-evaluated to assess 
further need of fluid challenges. Hemodynamic goals were based on the 2012 Surviving Sepsis guidelines: Give

5.2.3 Lactate 
Strong recommendation for 
WHO recommends the use of lactate measurement in addition to standard care to guide 
intravenous fluid management in patients with suspected or confirmed severe arboviral 
disease. [Strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence] 
• Measurement and interpretation must occur in conjunction with routine patient 
monitoring. 
• The recommendation is intended to support clinical decisions once intravenous 
fluid resuscitation has been commenced. It is not intended as routine monitoring for 
all patients. 
• Lactate is not useful for fluid monitoring in the context of liver failure, including 
yellow fever. 
 
5.2.3.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms 
Lactate-guided resuscitation, compared with standard of care in two trials reporting data 
from 430 participants, probably decreases mortality (4 fewer deaths per 1000, CI 95% 8 fewer - 
0 more). Lactate-guided resuscitation, compared with standard of care in one trial reporting 
data from 82 participants, may decrease ICU length of stay (1.5 fewer mean days, CI 95% 3 
fewer - 0.1 fewer). 
Lactate-guided resuscitation, compared with central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2)-
guided resuscitation, probably decreases mortality based on 4 randomized control trials 
reporting data from 772 participants (7 fewer deaths per 1000, CI 95% 10 fewer - 3 fewer by 29 
days post-intervention) and may decrease mechanical ventilation based on one study 
reporting data from 360 participants (14 fewer patients needing mechanical ventilation per 
1000, CI 95% 27 fewer - 7 more). 
The GDG inferred that serum lactate is beneficial both when compared to standard of care and 
when compared with central venous oxygen saturation monitoring. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Research evidence was only available for patients with sepsis. Two trials compared serum 
lactate with “standard of care” which was variably implemented by facility but included 
monitoring of hydration and haemodynamic status. Certainty of evidence for mortality was 
moderate due to imprecision (95% CI included no benefit, 180 events overall) and indirectness 
(data derived from patients with sepsis). Certainty of evidence for ICU length of stay, 
Recommendations specific to patients with severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral disease (hospitalized) 
 59 
compared with standard of care, was rated as low due to serious risk of bias (inadequate/lack 
of blinding with possible performance and detection biases), concerns with indirectness (data 
derived from patients with sepsis) and serious imprecision (82 patients overall). 
For ScvO2, certainty of evidence for mortality was moderate due to imprecision (180 events 
overall) and indirectness (data derived from patients with sepsis). Certainty of evidence for 
mechanical ventilation was low due to indirectness (data derived from patients with sepsis) 
and very serious imprecision (95% CI including benefits and harms, 60 events overall). 
Values and preferences 
Applying the agreed-upon values and preferences (see 3.2.3) for patients with severe disease, 
the GDG inferred that most patients, given the likely mortality benefit would choose to have 
lactate measurement in addition to standard care to guide intravenous fluid management. 
Resources and other considerations 
Resources and availability: Lactate is not readily measurable in many low-resource settings. 
The costs of measuring lactate include those of equipment and consumables (when used as 
either point-of-care, or through laboratory measurement). In the context of the 
recommendation, the GDG urged WHO to advance availability of lactate measurement 
through essential device mechanisms and other channels. 
The GDG agreed that the recommendation applies to arboviral disease in the absence of liver 
failure (which can occur in yellow fever) as the lactate measurement can be unreliable under 
these circumstances. Similarly, the panel judged that the recommendation would apply to 
pregnant and breastfeeding women and to children. 
5.2.3.2 Justification 
The GDG considered lactic-acid guided resuscitation with standard of care (as defined by the 
two respective studies). Evidence was presented to the GDG on ScvO2-guided resuscitation, 
although this was treated as secondary to comparisons of lactate with standard of care. All 
studies enrolled patients with sepsis, and outcomes for arboviral disease were not specifically 
available. Lactate was measured at intervals of two to three hours. 
The GDG agreed a strong recommendation for lactate-guided resuscitation but emphasised 
the non-inferiority of capillary refill time and its greater accessibility and lower costs. The 
panel judged that multiple comparisons which were favourable for lactate allowed a strong 
recommendation in favour of use, although noted some indirectness as the evidence did not 
derive from studies of patients with arbovirus. 
The GDG noted limitations in the use and interpretation of lactate, especially in liver failure. 
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
60 
5.2.3.3 Practical info 
What does blood lactate concentration indicate? 
Lactate is produced during anaerobic metabolism. Patients in shock typically have 
hypoperfusion, whereby lactate is produced and released into the circulation. Higher blood 
lactate levels are associated with poor patient outcomes. However, production of lactate may 
occur for many reasons, and changes in blood concentrations lag behind other physiological 
improvements. 
When guiding fluid resuscitation, blood lactate has been typically measured at 2 – 4 hourly 
intervals. 
Routine patient monitoring 
Lactate can be used as an adjunct to routine patient monitoring in severe disease including 
shock. However, it is mandatory to regularly and frequently measure physiological variables 
and urine output, and laboratory values where appropriate (such as haematocrit). Clinical 
measures of fluid response include blood pressure (including pulse pressure and mean 
arterial pressure), heart rate and urine output. Clinical indicators of imminent or worsening 
respiratory compromise, such as pulmonary oedema, include respiratory rate and oxygen 
saturations. 
How to use lactate to guide fluid therapy 
Different protocols have been used. Examples of successful haemodynamic resuscitation 
using lactate targets include: 
• lactate decrease of 10 or 30% measured every 2 hours (73),  
• lactate decrease of 10% measured every 3 hours (74), 
• lactate kinetics at 2 hours up to 10%, 4 hours up to 20% and 6 hours up to at least 30% 
(75), 
• targeted lactate clearance of at least 10% (76). 
Specific protocols for lactate-guided fluid administration should be based on relevant local or 
international guidance (38). 
  
Recommendations specific to patients with severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral disease (hospitalized) 
 61 
Cautions for use of lactate 
In general, clinical management of patients with dengue should be as minimally invasive as 
possible due to the bleeding associated with interventions. Care should be taken where more 
invasive sampling techniques (such as arterial lines) are used for lactate measurement. 
Capillary measurement provides an alternative. 
Lactate monitoring is unreliable in patients with liver failure, which is a feature of advanced 
yellow fever disease and can occur in severe dengue.

Recommendations specific to patients with severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral disease (hospitalized)

5.2.4 Passive leg raise test  
Conditional recommendation for 
WHO suggests the use of passive leg raise test in patients in shock, with suspected or 
confirmed arboviral disease, when the clinician is uncertain if further intravenous fluid 
administration is warranted. [Conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence] 
• The recommendation is intended to support clinical decisions once intravenous 
fluid resuscitation has been commenced. It is not intended as routine monitoring for 
all patients. 
• Real-time monitoring of cardiac output is required to most accurately interpret the 
results of a passive leg raise test. 
 
5.2.4.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms  
Benefits: In patients with suspected or confirmed arbovirus infection who will receive 
intravenous fluid infusion in an inpatient setting, cardiac output monitoring during passive leg 
raise may reduce mortality (2 fewer deaths per 1,000 patients than standard of care, 95% CI 5 
fewer - 5 more), and the need for mechanical ventilation (24/1000 fewer events, 95% CI 36 
fewer to 1 fewer).  
Harms: Prevention of pulmonary oedema was the GDGs primary concern in terms of over-
treatment with intravenous fluids, although specific data on this endpoint were not available. 
Overall, the panel judged there was unlikely to be harm from the use of passive leg raise.  
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence for mortality is rated as moderate, based on data from 462 
participants with sepsis across five studies (95% CI 7 fewer deaths to 6 more deaths). For 
mechanical ventilation, certainty was low, derived from a single study involving 120 
participants, downgraded due to serious risk of bias from inadequate blinding, imprecision 
due to the low number of events (28), and indirectness. The outcomes for renal replacement 
therapy, hospital length of stay and ICU length of stay were very low certainty. 
  
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
64 
Values and preferences 
Applying the agreed-upon values and preferences (see 3.2.3), for patients with severe disease, 
the GDG inferred that most, given the possible benefit and lack of harm, would choose to have 
the passive leg raise test performed to guide intravenous fluid management.  
Resources and other considerations 
Equity, acceptability, and feasibility: Ultrasound equipment is expensive, frequently 
unavailable and requires considerable training and maintenance of skills. Competence of the 
user will be an important determinant of accuracy and utility. 
5.2.4.2 Justification 
Six RCTs were identified that tested passive leg raise or bolus infusion-guided resuscitation vs 
standard of care, n=664 patients with sepsis.  
Known limitations of the test are severe hypovolaemia (where volumes of venous blood in the 
legs are small), and where intra-abdominal pressure is raised. 
A sensitivity analysis that only looked at the passive leg raise test was highly similar (n=462 
septic patients, in 5 RCTs) but with lower quality of evidence. The GDG decided to recommend 
separately for passive leg raise and monitored fluid bolus approaches. 
The panel noted that measures of responsiveness to passive leg raise tests were 
heterogeneous across studies, and a specific recommendation on which technique to use 
could not be made. 
The GDG noted differences in arboviral disease pathophysiology, but also the difficulty of 
clinical differentiation in the absence of rapidly available laboratory diagnostics. They noted 
specifically that chikungunya patients may be more prone to myocarditis, especially at 
extremes of age, and that plasma leakage in dengue can be profound.  
5.2.4.3 Practical info 
What is evaluated by the passive leg raise test (PLR)? 
PLR is used to predict whether further volume expansion will increase cardiac output (and 
therefore potentially end-organ perfusion). During PLR, approximately 150-300 ml of venous 
blood from the legs is transferred quickly to the central circulation. An immediate increase in 
cardiac output demonstrates preload responsiveness. This mimics a fluid challenge without 
actual fluid infusion; hemodynamic effects are quickly reversible the risk of fluid overload is 
minimized (77,78).  
  
Recommendations specific to patients with severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral disease (hospitalized) 
 65 
How to measure cardiac output response to passive leg raise or bolus intravenous fluid 
Possible measures of cardiac output include visualisation by ultrasound / echocardiography 
and thermodilution techniques. Blood pressure is an indirect measure, and a less reliable 
indicator of preload responsiveness. The choice of measure will depend on specific clinical 
contexts and available resources. Other measures of venous filling, such as static measures of 
inferior vena cava diameter may be helpful in some circumstances but are not considered 
here. 
PLR test protocol  
• Positioning the patient semi-recumbent at 45° 
• Record the cardiac output at baseline. This may be an average of multiple 
measurements.  
• Quickly lower the patient flat, and lift both legs to at least 45° from the horizontal. 
• Record the cardiac output again, as soon as possible after the manoeuvre (maximal 
effect takes place between 30 and 90 seconds). 
• Reposition the patient according to clinical need. 
Figure 5-2. Suggested way to perform standardized passive leg raise test 
 
Notes: Ensure you are using a bed in which the patient can be rapidly repositioned without discomfort. 1 - 
Position the patient semi-recumbent at 45 degrees. 2 – Record the patient’s cardiac output. The chosen 
modality of measurement will depend on equipment, tra ining and resources. The most direct and 
reproducible measurements employ echocardiography or thermodilution techniques. 3 – Lower patient’s 
torso to horizontal position and lift both legs to 45 degrees. 4 – Repeat the measurement of cardiac output 
within 30 to 90 seconds. When complete, return the patient to a clinically appropriate position. 
How to interpret the result 
In the context of shock, preload responsiveness is indicated by a PLR-related increase in 
cardiac output from baseline of more than 10% (79,80). Being a less reliable measure, 
thresholds for improvements in other more indirect measures of cardiac output are not 
known. 

WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
66 
How to act on the result 
The decision to administer fluids should be individualized, using a cycle of assessment, 
intervention, and reassessment. 
In a patient with haemodynamic instability and/or signs of circulatory shock: 
• a positive PLR test indicates preload responsiveness and a lower risk of fluid overload. 
A positive PLR should give the clinician more confidence to proceed with a fluid bolus, 
with appropriate monitoring and reassessment. 
• a negative PLR test indicates that further fluid administration may not result in 
physiological improvement and may increase the risk of fluid overload. A negative PLR 
should prompt evaluation of non-hypovolaemic causes of shock, and act as a caution 
that further intravenous fluids that alternative approaches, such as vasoactive 
medication may be more immediately appropriate (81). 
After any fluid administration, the PLR can be repeated. 
Cautions and contraindications 
• Known limitations of the test are severe hypovolaemia (where volumes of venous 
blood in the legs are small), and where discomfort or adrenergic stimulation is 
provoked by the test (82). 
• Moving of patients before, during and after PLR requires care to minimise discomfort, 
and to ensure the appropriate positioning is maintained during the rest of care (for 
example supine or semi-recumbent as clinically indicated). 
• PLR is contraindicated for patients with: 
o traumatic brain injuries due to the risks of increasing intracranial pressure. 
o deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs due to the risk of dislodging a clot.  
o fractures of the lower extremities or leg amputations due to effects on the 
volume of blood recruited by the test. 
o venous compression stockings  
Training and competency 
Proper training and competence are essential for accurate assessment and patient safety. 
Health care professionals should receive comprehensive training on the procedure, including 
the correct positioning of the patient, accurate recording of hemodynamic parameters and 
interpretation of results. Regular competency assessments and refresher courses are 
recommended to maintain high standards of practice.

5.3 Corticosteroids (for severe disease) 
Conditional recommendation against 
WHO suggests against the use of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with 
suspected or confirmed severe arboviral disease. [Conditional recommendation, very low 
certainty evidence] 
• For patients on established corticosteroid therapy, the decision to continue should 
be made according to anticipated risk/benefit balance. 
 
5.3.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms 
Benefits: In patients with severe arboviral disease, it is uncertain whether steroids increase or 
decrease mortality (6 fewer deaths per 1000, 95% CI 12 fewer – 3 more, at 5-day follow up) 
based on data from 258 participants in 3 studies. Corticosteroids have little or no impact on 
length of hospital stay (0.55 mean days longer, 95% CI 0.53 fewer – 1.63 more) based on data 
from 124 participants in 2 studies. 
Harms: Corticosteroids probably increase gastrointestinal bleeding (11 more per 1000, 95% CI 
6 more-17 more) based on data from 33 253 participants without arboviral disease in 159 
RCTs. Corticosteroids may increase severe adverse events (28 more per 1000, 95% CI 40 
fewer – 145 more) based on data from 468 participants in 3 studies. It is uncertain whether 
steroid use increases or decreases organ failure or severe bleeding. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Certainty of evidence was rated as low for effect on length of hospital stay, based on data 
from 124 participants in 2 studies due to serious inconsistency and serious imprecision. 
Certainty was rated as very low for mortality, organ failure and severe bleeding. Certainty of 
evidence was rated as moderate for gastrointestinal bleeding, based on data from 33 253 
participants in 159 RCTs; however, these were patients without arboviral disease and there 
were thus concerns with indirectness and imprecision. The median duration of corticosteroid 
treatment was 8.5 days (IQR 3.3–28.0), and the appreciation that short and longer course of 
steroids might have different adverse events contributed to the very low certainty rating. 
Certainty of evidence was rated as low for severe adverse events, based on data from 468 
participants in three studies, due to very serious imprecision.

 71 
Values and preferences 
Applying the agreed-upon values and preferences (see 3.2.3) for patients with severe disease, 
the GDG inferred that most patients would choose to avoid corticosteroids because of overall 
evidence suggesting potential harm without strong evidence of benefit. 
Resources and other considerations 
The panel intended that the recommendation apply to chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and 
Zika. 
5.3.2 Justification 
The GDG noted that corticosteroids are variably and inconsistently used in the management 
of several non-arboviral acute infections and sepsis, and there is little evidence for benefit in 
the published data on use in arboviral infections, particularly dengue. Members were 
concerned about the adverse event profile of corticosteroids and the potential for negative 
effects of immunosuppression. 
Some panel members noted that corticosteroids have been used in the management of 
patients with certain disease manifestations and sequelae caused by arboviral infections. 
Examples cited included acute viral myocarditis and chikungunya encephalitis. In the absence 
of robust specific evidence, individual judgement should be made for these and other 
manifestations of severe arboviral disease. 
The panel identified evaluation of corticosteroids in dengue as a research priority.

Mechanism of action, adverse event profile and availability 
Please, refer to Section 4.3 for further information. 
The recommendation refers only to systemic (not local or topic) corticosteroids. Additionally, 
some patients develop conditions complicating their arboviral infection that may, in the 
clinician’s assessment, benefit from corticosteroids, for example, uveitis, myocarditis, or 
severe pruritus.

5.4 Immunoglobulins 
Conditional recommendation against 
WHO suggests against the use of immunoglobulins in the treatment of patients with 
suspected or confirmed severe arboviral disease. [Conditional recommendation, very low 
certainty evidence] 
 
5.4.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms  
It is unclear whether the use if immunoglobulins increases or decreases mortality, based on 
data from 77 participants in 2 studies (13 fewer deaths per 1000, CI 95% 19 fewer – 52 more), 
bleeding based on data from 31 participants in 1 study (22 fewer events per 1000, CI 95% 39 
fewer – 3 more), or adverse events based on data from 31 participants in one study (64 more 
events per 1000, CI 95% 59 fewer – 152 more). 
Certainty of the evidence 
Three RCTs were identified that evaluated the effect of administration of either anti-D Rho 
hyperimmune globulin (two studies) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (one study). There 
were two studies that assessed mortality based on data from 79 participants; one study that 
assessed severe bleeding based on data from 31 participants; and one that assessed any 
adverse events based on data from 31 participants. Certainty across outcomes was rated as 
very low because of serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision. 
Values and preferences 
Applying the agreed-upon values and preferences (see 3.2.3) for patients with severe disease, 
the GDG inferred that most patients would choose to avoid immunoglobulins because of 
overall evidence suggesting absence of evidence of benefit. 
Resources and other considerations 
Immunoglobulin preparations are expensive and not readily available in resource-limited 
settings. Given the paucity of supplies, the GDG emphasized the importance of using available 
immunoglobulins for indications with evidence of beneficial effect, e.g., IVIG in patients with 
Guillain-Barré syndrome. 
  
Recommendations specific to patients with severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral disease (hospitalized) 
 75 
5.4.2 Justification 
The GDG noted the lack of evidence demonstrating benefit in the routine use of 
immunoglobulins in patients with arboviral disease and the need to reserve use for 
indications with evidence of clinical benefit.  
The GDG used indicative voting during the debate, where the initial position of 'research-only' 
was the most popular. However, a significant minority felt that this was too restrictive for 
clinicians, as it would be closer to a ‘strong against’ recommendation than a ‘conditional 
against’ one. Further discussions led to a consensus on a 'conditional against' stance among 
all members, allowing clinicians the latitude to consider its use in a minority of patients. 
5.4.3 Practical Information 
Mechanism of action 
Immunoglobulins are used therapeutically to bind to epitopes on infectious agents in the 
absence of host immunity, or to bind antibodies responsible for adverse immune or 
autoimmune conditions. IVIG is a blood product derived from pooled human sera, 
intravenously administered, which contains a broad array of antibodies. Anti-D Rho 
hyperimmune globulin is the IgG fraction of plasma from pooled D-positive red-cell-
immunized donors that is used primarily for Rh isoimmunization suppression in obstetric 
settings and for immune thrombocytopenic purpura. 
Immunoglobulins have been used in the management of patients with some clinical sequelae 
of arboviral infections, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, for which IVIG has been shown to be 
of benefit (83).

5.5 Platelet transfusion 
Conditional recommendation against 
WHO suggests against the use of prophylactic platelet transfusion in patients with 
suspected or confirmed severe arboviral disease and platelet count of <50,000 
platelets/microlitre who have no active bleeding. [Conditional recommendation, low 
certainty evidence] 
• The panel noted the specific circumstances in which platelet transfusion may be 
indicated, including prevention of haemorrhage in surgery or other invasive 
procedure and pre-existing anticoagulation treatment. 
 
5.5.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms 
Benefits: Based on data from 372 participants in one observational study comparing 
outcomes in patients who received platelet transfusions with those who did not, platelet 
transfusion may decrease length of hospital stay (1 fewer mean days’ duration, CI 95% 1.32 
fewer – 0.7 fewer). 
Harms: It was uncertain whether platelet transfusion increases or decreases mortality (11 
more events per 1000 based on data from 460 participants in 2 studies, CI 95% 13 fewer – 34 
more), severe bleeding (7 fewer events per 1000 based on data from 460 participants in 2 
studies, CI 95% 22 fewer – 75 more), clinical bleeding (23 fewer events per 1000, CI 95% 13 
fewer – 34 more based on data from 450 patients in two randomized control trials; 2 more per 
1000, CI 95% 11 fewer – 13 more based on data from 788 participants in a non-randomized 
study) organ failure (1 fewer per 1000 based on data from 372 participants in one study, CI 
95% 21 fewer – 21 more) or severe adverse events (15 more events per 1000 based on data 
from 460 participants in 2 studies, CI 95% 2 fewer – 32 more). 
In addition to the data summarized from the systematic review, the GDG noted that platelet 
transfusion can be associated with the transmission of additional blood-borne pathogens, 
and results in additional intravenous volumes of fluid. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Research evidence was limited to dengue. This evidence was indirectly applied to other 
arboviral infections.  
The evidence summary on administration of platelets to patients with dengue and 
thrombocytopenia was informed by two randomized controlled trials and one retrospective 
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
78 
non-randomized observational study, and the number of patients informing estimates varied 
across outcomes from 372 to 788 patients. There was very low certainty of effect on mortality, 
severe bleeding, clinical bleeding, organ failure and severe adverse events because of serious 
imprecision and serious risk of bias. 
Values and preferences 
Applying the agreed-upon values and preferences (see 3.2.3), for patients with severe disease, 
the GDG inferred that most patients suffering severe arboviral disease, given the lack of 
benefit and considering possible harms, would not choose to receive platelet transfusion.  
Resources and other considerations 
Platelet availability may be low in many settings due to cost, the availability of donors or 
inadequate laboratory and storage facilities. Ensuring safety of blood products, and 
prevention of viral transmission from donors is also a concern in resource-limited settings. 
Blood products may not be acceptable to all patients, for example, patients with religious 
objections to receiving them. 
The recommendation applies to pregnant and breastfeeding women and to children. 
5.5.2 Justification 
The conditional recommendation against the administration of platelets in patients with 
thrombocytopenia and with no active bleeding rests on the lack of demonstrated benefit and 
consequent irrational use of scarce resources. In addition, the use of platelets introduces risk 
of transfusion-transmitted infections and further risk of fluid overload. 
The use of platelets in the absence of bleeding may be appropriate in specific circumstances, 
for example preceding a surgical procedure with anticipated blood loss. A threshold of 10 000 
platelets per microlitre was discussed for prophylactic platelet transfusion based on earlier 
WHO recommendations (33) 
The GDG intended this recommendation to apply to dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow 
fever. 
5.5.3 Practical info 
Dengue infections are frequently accompanied by thrombocytopenia from day 3 and day 8 
following onset of illness. The mechanism is multifactorial but remains incompletely 
understood.  
For conditions other than dengue, platelet transfusions are usually administered to treat or 
prevent bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction, depending on 
the patient's clinical condition and accompanying platelet concentration thresholds. 
However, considerations are different in dengue accounting for the pathophysiology of the 
Recommendations specific to patients with severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral disease (hospitalized) 
 79 
disease, the expected spontaneous resolution of thrombocytopenia and the low likelihood of 
thrombocytopenia-induced haemorrhage in most patients with dengue. 
In patients who do have bleeding, additional work-up is required, including other markers of 
coagulation dysfunction (for example, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin 
time and fibrinogen level).

Recommendations specific to patients with severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral disease (hospitalized) 
 81 
5.6 Specific management of yellow fever 
Most individuals with yellow fever are asymptomatic or have mild disease which can be 
mistaken for other nonspecific febrile illness. In a minority of patients, after a period of 
remission, illness reappears in a more severe form, with high fever, vomiting, prostration, and 
dehydration. 
Hepatic-induced coagulopathy produces severe haemorrhagic manifestations, including 
petechiae, ecchymoses, epistaxis and hematemesis. Yellow fever is distinguished from other 
viral haemorrhagic fevers by the characteristic severity of liver damage and the appearance of 
jaundice. Acute kidney injury frequently leads to extreme albuminuria. Late central nervous 
system manifestations such as confusion, seizure and coma are often associated with death.  
5.6.1 N-acetylcysteine 
Conditional recommendation for 
WHO suggests the use of intravenous N-acetylcysteine in the treatment of patients with 
liver failure due to probable or confirmed yellow fever. [Conditional recommendation, very 
low certainty evidence] 
• This recommendation applies when the use of N-acetylcysteine is in adequate 
supply within the health system and does not compromise its availability to patients 
who have therapeutic need for it and where there is greater certainty of efficacy (e.g. 
paracetamol overdose). 
 
5.6.1.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms 
Benefits: It is unclear whether N-acetylcysteine treatment might improve the prognosis for 
patients with liver failure secondary to yellow fever virus infection. It is uncertain whether N-
acetylcysteine treatment decreases mortality, reduces the use of mechanical ventilation, 
decreases the chance of liver transplant, and reduces severe bleeding or length of hospital 
stay.  
Harms: It is uncertain if N-acetylcysteine effects the occurrence of severe adverse events 
based on one study of 184 patients with 11 more adverse events (95% CI 28 fewer to 151 more) 
at 365 days following treatment. Retrospective studies (in patients with liver failure) reported 
that anaphylactoid reactions led to treatment interruption in a very small percentage of 
patients (2%). Harms of anaphylactoid reactions were noted and felt to be relatively 
unimportant considering the stated expected values and preferences for patients with severe 
disease. 
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
82 
Certainty of the evidence 
The evidence summary on use of N-acetylcysteine for patients with liver failure secondary to 
yellow fever was informed by five randomized and non-randomized studies on patients with 
liver failure secondary to infectious diseases other than yellow fever and on patients with liver 
failure secondary to non-infectious diseases. 
Certainty of evidence was rated low for severe adverse events and very low for all other 
outcomes based primarily on very serious imprecision. Indirect evidence was available for 
studies on outcomes of severe bleeding, length of hospital stay and mechanical ventilation. 
Values and preferences 
Applying the agreed upon values and preferences (see 3.2.3), for patients with severe disease, 
the GDG inferred that most, given the possible benefit and minimal harms, would choose to 
use intravenous N-acetylcysteine for liver failure due to yellow fever.  
Resources and other considerations 
N-acetylcysteine is a highly effective antidote to treat paracetamol (acetaminophen) 
overdose. The GDG were cognizant of the risk of shortage of this extremely valuable 
countermeasure in case of widespread use. Given the uncertainty of its benefit in patients 
with liver failure secondary to yellow fever, it was noted that the use of N-acetylcysteine 
requires an adequate supply within the health system, and that its use in this context should 
not compromise the availability to other patients. N-acetylcysteine is on the WHO’s List of 
Essential Medicines (47) and is available as an inexpensive generic drug. 
5.6.1.2 Justification 
The GDG specified that the target population for this recommendation is adult patients with 
severe yellow fever. There were no RCTs on the use of N-acetylcysteine for treatment of liver 
failure in this population. 
Indirect evidence from patients with other infectious disease-induced liver failure provided 
low certainty evidence for mortality, severe bleeding and length of hospital stay. In general, 
the WHO does not make strong recommendations when evidence of critical outcomes is only 
low certainty. In this situation, the GDG felt that the potential benefits in a disease with 
particularly poor prognosis outweighed the minimal harms and costs. The panel encouraged 
evaluation of N-acetylcysteine in yellow fever as a research priority. 
5.6.1.3 Practical info 
Mechanism of action 
N-acetylcysteine is frequently used to prevent free – radical-related hepatotoxicity resulting 
from paracetamol overdose. Molecular mechanisms may include direct oxidant scavenging, 
Recommendations specific to patients with severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral disease (hospitalized) 
 83 
glutathione replenishment, reduction of disulfides and increased H2S and sulfane sulfur 
species inside cells(84). 
Adverse event profile 
The most commonly reported adverse effects of intravenous acetylcysteine are anaphylactoid 
reactions, including rash, pruritus, angioedema, bronchospasm, tachycardia, and 
hypotension. Within a trial of loading doses in the treatment of paracetamol overdose, these 
have been seen to occur in approximately 15% (of total n=180), although discontinuation due 
to adverse reaction occurred in 2%(85). Retrospective study has found adverse event rates of 
5% (4/76 participants). 
Route, dosage, and duration 
This recommendation concerns N-acetylcysteine as an intravenous medication (200 mg/mL, 
in a 10 mL ampoule) (47). 
Different dosage and administration schedules have been adopted for various conditions. 
However, the panel endorsed the use according to established protocols for acute 
acetaminophen ingestion, as follows:

Dose adjustment 
Renal impairment: No data are available to determine if dose adjustment in moderate or 
severe renal impairment is required. 
Hepatic impairment: Although there was a threefold increase in acetylcysteine plasma 
concentrations in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, no data are available to determine if a dose 
adjustment in these patients is required. 
Other considerations  
Children: The mean elimination (t1/2) of acetylcysteine is longer in newborns (11 hours) than in 
adults (5.6 hours). Pharmacokinetic information is not available in other age groups. 
Pregnancy: In four pregnant women with paracetamol (acetaminophen) toxicity, oral or IV 
acetylcysteine was administered at the time of delivery. Acetylcysteine was detected in the 
cord blood of three viable infants and in cardiac blood of a fourth infant, sampled at autopsy. 
Breastfeeding: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many 
drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when acetylcysteine is 
administered to a nursing woman.

5.6.2 Intravenous monoclonal immunoglobulin TY014 for yellow fever 
Only in research settings 
WHO recommends the use of monoclonal immunoglobulin TY014 for the treatment of 
patients with suspected or confirmed yellow fever only in research settings. [Use only in 
research, very low certainty evidence] 
• Given the challenge of a randomized controlled trial in rare diseases, clinical trials 
could be conducted during outbreaks through pre-positioned trial protocols and 
under the monitored emergency use of unregistered and investigational 
interventions (MEURI) framework (88). 
 
5.6.2.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms 
In patients with yellow fever disease, it is unknown whether monoclonal immunoglobulin 
TY014 may improve prognosis. The use of monoclonal immunoglobulin TY014 has not been 
assessed in humans infected with yellow fever virus. 
Benefit: Experimental human challenge (phase I) of healthy subjects demonstrated no 
viraemia in 8 individuals given the TY014 and the yellow fever vaccine, but detectable virus in 
2 individuals receiving placebo.  
Harm: From 37 participants, RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.71-1.46), 16 more events per 1000 would be 
expected in those treated with TY014 (95% CI 232 fewer to 368 more). 
Certainty of the evidence 
There were no published data from studies on the use of monoclonal immunoglobulin TY014 
in humans infected with yellow fever virus. Evidence on critical outcomes in patients with 
yellow fever disease is absent.  
Evidence of viral clearance in experimental human challenge data was very low certainty due 
to serious indirectness and imprecision. 
Evidence of adverse events was low certainty due to serious risk of bias and very serious 
imprecision. 
Values and preferences 
The GDG inferred that almost all informed patients would choose not to have TY014 as a 
treatment except in the context of a clinical trial.  
Recommendations specific to patients with severe, suspected or confirmed, arboviral disease (hospitalized) 
 87 
Resources and other considerations 
There is lack of availability of monoclonal immunoglobulin TY014 in most settings, 
particularly low resource settings. Monoclonal immunoglobulin TY014 is an unlicensed, 
unregistered medication. 
5.6.2.2 Justification 
Given the absence of specific treatment options for yellow fever, the high mortality in patients 
progressing to the toxic phase and developing severe disease, there is a need for improved 
understanding of potential therapeutics such as monoclonal immunoglobulin TY014 to 
improve patient outcomes. Given that monoclonal immunoglobulin TY014 is an unregistered 
drug without regulatory approval for treating yellow fever, the panel recommended for 
research settings only. Clinical trials will help inform the impact of critical outcomes as well as 
the timing of administration during disease progression. Because yellow fever is a rare 
disease, the optimal period for a trial would be during outbreaks, especially those occurring in 
urban areas. Pre-established protocols, and appropriate ethical and regulatory clearance will 
be required. 
Currently, there is no licensed antiviral therapy for yellow fever virus. Therefore, managing 
severe cases, particularly in at-risk groups, relies on supportive care. This highlights an unmet 
need for both therapeutic and prophylactic measures to effectively manage yellow fever (89). 
5.6.2.3 Practical Information 
Mechanism of action 
TY014 is a fully engineered human IgG1 monoclonal antibody designed to combat the yellow 
fever virus. It is produced using Chinese hamster ovary cells. TY014 targets the envelope (E) 
protein on the virus’s surface, preventing the virus from entering and replicating within host 
cells. Non-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the safety profile and efficacy 
in inhibiting yellow fever virus infection. TY014 is currently being explored as a post-infection 
therapy for yellow fever (89).

5.6.3 Sofosbuvir 
Only in research settings  
WHO recommends the use of sofosbuvir in the treatment of patients with suspected or 
confirmed yellow fever only in research settings. [Use only in research, very low certainty 
evidence] 
• Given the challenge of a randomized controlled trial in rare diseases, clinical trials 
could be conducted during outbreaks through pre-positioned trial protocols and 
under the monitored emergency use of unregistered and investigational 
interventions (MEURI) framework. 
 
5.6.3.1 Evidence to decision 
Benefits and harms 
In patients with yellow fever disease, it is unknown whether sofosbuvir may improve 
prognosis. 
There are no data on adverse effects of sofosbuvir in patients with yellow fever. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The evidence summary was informed by one single-arm intervention study of patients with 
yellow fever. There was no information on important clinical outcomes. Certainty of evidence 
was rated very low for viral clearance due to serious risk of bias and imprecision. 
Values and preferences 
The GDG inferred that almost all informed patients would choose not to have sofosbuvir as a 
treatment except in the context of a clinical trial. 
Resources and other considerations 
Sofosbuvir is available in some areas where it has been developed and tested for viral 
hepatitis C. It is not licensed for use in yellow fever. 
5.6.3.2 Justification 
There are no published data from randomized control trials on the use of sofosbuvir in 
patients with yellow fever (90).  
Given the absence of specific treatment options for yellow fever, the high mortality in patients 
progressing to the toxic phase and developing severe disease, there is a need for improved 
understanding of potential antivirals to improve patient outcomes. Given that sofosbuvir is an 
antiviral used to treat hepatitis C (also in the Flavivirus family) it may improve outcomes of 
WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 
90 
patients with yellow fever. Given the lack of evidence, the panel recommended for research 
settings only. Clinical trials will help inform the impact of critical outcomes as well as the 
timing of administration during disease progression. As yellow fever is a rare disease, the 
optimal period for a trial would be during outbreaks, especially those occurring in urban 
areas. Pre-established protocols, and appropriate ethical and regulatory clearance will be 
required. 
5.6.3.3 Practical Information 
Mechanism of action  
Sofosbuvir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA-dependent 
RNA polymerase, which is essential for viral replication. It is a nucleotide prodrug that 
undergoes intracellular metabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analog 
triphosphate (GS-461203), which can be incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase 
and acts as a chain terminator. GS-461203 (the active metabolite of sofosbuvir) is not an 
inhibitor of human DNA and RNA polymerases or an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA 
polymerase (91). 
Rationale 
No specific treatment options for yellow fever exist, and patients receive solely intensive 
palliative care. Therefore, antivirals with anti-flavivirus activity may represent an important 
alternative for drug repurposing in an attempt to improve patient outcomes(92).

7 Guideline-relevant research needs and 
limitations 
The GDG identified the following questions as priorities for research to improve the care of 
patients with arbovirus infection: 
1. Disease progression and classification:  
• What are the clinical features, laboratory tests and biomarkers that can accurately 
identify patients at high risk of progressing from non-severe to severe disease (e.g. 
dengue and other arboviruses) and which can lead to clinically actionable 
interventions? 
• What are the clinical features that allow accurate identification of patients at high risk 
of poor outcomes, especially those with severe disease (e.g., dengue and other 
arboviruses)? 
• Develop tools to predict the progression from non-severe to severe disease (beyond 
commonly observed warning signs, which may occur with high prevalence and 
overwhelm health systems). 
• Investigating discriminant clinical and biological markers between diseases, 
potentially incorporating the kinetics and durations of associated features, could 
enhance the development of predictive scores and improve diagnostic accuracy 
2. Disease management: 
• Compare the efficacy of crystalloid versus colloid solutions in managing severe 
arboviral diseases. 
• Investigate subgroups of patients in whom colloids may be clinically advantageous.  
• Compare the efficacy of different fluid resuscitation protocols to determine the most 
effective approach for patient outcomes. 
• How should multiple measures of fluid resuscitation such as capillary refill and lactate 
levels, be incorporated into patient management? 
• Evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for the treatment of severe disease, especially 
in dengue, to determine their impact on patient outcomes. 
• Evaluate of corticosteroids for treatment and fluid management for neonates with 
shock. 
3. Arbovirus-specific research: 
• Dengue: 
o Identify disease phenotypes which have utility in guiding patient 
management 
o Understand the phases of volume resuscitation in dengue and dengue 
shock syndrome 
Guideline-relevant research needs and limitations 
 93 
o Explore the role haematocrit in modifying patient management 
strategies.  
• Chikungunya:  
o Evaluate the use of NSAIDs and control of pain in the post-acute 
phases of disease 
o Assess optimal strategies for using disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drugs (DMARDs) in the chronic stage. 
o Assess the potential benefits of immunoglobulins in neonates, 
including the evaluation of specific IgG versus non-specific IgG. 
o Investigate the effectiveness of immunoglobulins in preventing 
vertical transmission. 
o Investigate shock mechanisms in chikungunya and its management.  
• Zika: 
o Evaluate the role of antipruritic medications. 
o Evaluate the role of corticosteroids and immunoglobulins in Zika-
associated neurological disease (encephalitis, Guillain-Barré 
syndrome). 
o Investigate the potential use of medical countermeasures during 
pregnancy to mitigate the risk of congenital diseases, with a specific 
focus on the efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibodies. 
• Yellow fever: 
o Accelerate evidence generation by having pre-established research 
protocols for evaluating potential therapeutics. 
o Research monoclonal antibody treatment.  
o Assess the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in yellow fever. 
o Evaluate the effect of plasmapheresis on severe yellow fever. 
o Evaluate the effect of sofosbuvir on severe yellow fever. 
4. Inclusive evidence generation: 
•  Ensure that evidence generation includes all patient populations, including those 
frequently excluded from trials (children, immunocompromised, pregnant women).

94 
8 Publication, dissemination, monitoring and 
evaluation 
Guidelines will be disseminated through WHO 3-level structures, and to partner organizations 
as both electronic document and online resources. 
The impact of the guidelines will at high level be monitored through international data on 
clinical outcomes of arboviral diseases. Member states and guideline users will be encouraged 
to report where guidelines have been systematically deployed. In subsequent country and 
regional implementation projects, WHO arbovirus teams will ascertain specifically which 
guidelines are in use. 
Facilities and end-users are encouraged to perform clinical audit of the use of the guideline 
recommendations amongst their patients. Within this guideline, no specific targets are set so 
that the independence of localisation and national strategies are not compromised; local 
targets should be set before audit. 
Several implementation tools are being developed to help end-users, specifically clinicians, to 
make decisions and support quality-improvement in arbovirus care. 
There is no planned obsolescence date for the guideline, but the WHO arbovirus team will 
monitor the evolving research landscape for large-impact clinical studies which would 
precipitate a guideline review. We will use our internal steering group, GDG and broader 
networks to consult on such changes.

Annex 1. Declarations of Interest 
The technical unit collected and managed written statements of declarations of interest (DOI). 
All DOI forms were reviewed by the WHO Secretariat. Consultation with WHO Quality Norms 
and Standards team and Ethics teams were obtained, when necessary. Conflicts of interest 
were declared by three panel members related to institutional research funding but were not 
deemed grounds for panel ineligibility. At the start of each meeting, the WHO Secretariat 
described the DOI process and GDG members were asked to verbally update any other DOI; no 
verbal conflicts were declared. Web searches did not identify any additional interests that 
would likely affect members' independence. 
A declarations of interest noted by the GDG members and methodologist are shown in the 
table below.

Annex 2. Arbovirus baseline risk estimates 
survey 
A short survey to determine which baseline absolute rates of clinical outcomes should be used 
when considering evidence for the WHO Clinical management of arbovirus guidelines. 
Many thanks in advance for taking the time to complete this short survey. It is of critical 
importance that the GDG respond, because it will determine how information on the effect of 
interventions is presented to them. That information will be used during deliberations to 
create the guideline recommendations. 
The aim 
• To produce a guideline which is cohesive, and which clinicians and patients can use to 
understand the benefits and harms they might receive. 
The issues 
1. Research study participants are often different than the wider patient population. They 
are always selected, and so differences might be expected in, for example, the severity 
of their disease and their outcomes (amongst other things). 
2. Research studies looking at one aspect of disease treatment may not include patients 
with exactly the same risk/severity as studies which look at another aspect. 
The solution 
• We use the treatment effect found in the research studies as our starting place. 
• We select a "baseline absolute risk" for each outcome which is the same throughout 
the guideline. This is the risk associated with standard care, or placebo. It is how 
frequently we expect to see this outcome in "normal" (or non-study) patients. We 
usually give this as a number per 1000 patients. 
• We apply the treatment effect from the studies to this baseline absolute risk, which 
shows how frequently we expect to see that outcome in treated patients. This gives us 
an estimate of the actual difference a treatment will make (per 1000 patients, for 
example). 
One more small problem! 
• We don't have baseline estimates of absolute rates of the outcomes in "normal" 
patients. Of course, there will be some variability. We have looked for data from 
observational and randomised studies, and so we can describe the range which has 
been seen. 
This survey asks you to make a decision about what baseline rates we should use. 
Annex 2. Arbovirus baseline risk estimates survey 
 103 
How does this survey work? 
• We will present you every outcome in turn. 
• For each outcome, we will give you 5 different values of potential baseline rates. They 
will span the lowest and highest rates from existing studies. 
• We ask you to think "what is the rate I would expect in real patient populations". We 
will give you information about where the patients are being seen. For example, those 
presenting to primary care clinics, and those admitted to hospital will be different. The 
same is true for disease. For example, dengue patients have different outcomes from 
zika patients. 
• You should select one value which represents the rate you think is most relevant for 
that population.

Annex 3. Protocol for the systematic review to 
inform a clinical practice guideline on the 
management of arboviral diseases 
Title: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Interventions for the Management of Arboviral 
Diseases: Informing Clinical Practice Guidelines for Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, and Yellow 
Fever 
1. Introduction 
1.1 Background and Rationale: 
Arboviral diseases, including Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever, continue to 
present significant challenges in terms of morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. The 
objective of this systematic review is to comprehensively evaluate and synthesize the existing 
evidence on interventions for the management of arboviral diseases, providing a foundation 
for the development of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. 
1.2 Objectives: 
• To identify and evaluate the effectiveness of medical interventions for the 
management of Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever. 
• To assess the safety and adverse effects associated with these interventions. 
• To determine the impact of interventions on clinical outcomes, including symptom 
resolution, disease progression, and mortality. 
• To provide a robust evidence base for the development of clinical practice guidelines. 
2. Methods 
2.1 Eligibility Criteria: 
The populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest will be selected by de 
guideline development group (GDG). 
The question development process will include: 
• Identification of populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest 
• Identification of subgroups of interest (effect modification and different baseline risks) 
• Outcome prioritization and definition of outcome relevance (i.e. utilities) 
 
For questions on the health effects of interventions we will search for randomized controlled 
studies (RCT) (primary search described below). In cases in we don’t find RCT or the overall 
certainty of the evidence results very low we will consider conducting additional searches to 
Annex 3. Protocol for the systematic review to inform a clinical practice guideline on the management of 
arboviral diseases 
 107 
identify high quality non-RCT.1 For questions about other aspects of the evidence to decision 
process, not related to health effects of interventions (e.g. resource utilization) we will search 
for systematic reviews. 
2.2 Search Strategy: 
A comprehensive systematic search will be conducted in electronic databases (Medline, 
Embase, Cochrane Library and LILACS) from inception to [insert end date].

2.3 Study Selection: 
Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts for eligibility. Full-text articles of 
potentially relevant studies will be assessed for inclusion. Discrepancies will be resolved 
through discussion and, if necessary, by a third reviewer. 
2.4 Data Extraction: 
A standardized data extraction form will be developed, including study characteristics, 
interventions, comparators, outcomes, and key findings. Two reviewers will independently 
extract data from included studies. 
2.5 Data Synthesis: 
We will conduct meta-analysis, when feasible, using frequentist random-effects models. We 
will perform subgroup analyses considering potential effect modifiers identified during the 
question development process. In addition, we will perform sensitivity analysis excluding high 
risk of bias studies when feasible. 
We will conduct a frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) when multiple 
interventions are available for a specific scenario. This approach allows for the comparison of 
multiple treatments simultaneously while accounting for both direct and indirect evidence. 
To estimate the between-study variance, we will use the restricted maximum likelihood 
(REML) method, which provides robust variance estimates and improves the precision of 
effect estimates in the presence of heterogeneity. 
2.6 Certainty of the evidence Assessment: 
We will assess the certainty of evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, 
development and evaluation (GRADE) approach.2 Two methodologists with experience in 
using GRADE will rate each domain for each comparison separately and will resolve 
discrepancies by consensus. We will rate the certainty for each comparison and outcome as 
high, moderate, low, or very low, based on considerations of risk of bias, inconsistency, 
indirectness, publication bias and imprecision. To assess risk of bias we will use the Cochrane 
2.0 tool.3 To assess the risk of bias resulting from missing data we will perform sensitivity 
analysis including missing participants and assuming more and less plausible event rates.4 We 
will make judgements of imprecision using a minimally contextualised approach with the null 
effect as a threshold. This minimally contextualised approach considers whether the CI 
includes the null effect, or, when the point estimate is close to the null effect, whether the CI 
lies within the boundaries of small but important benefit and harm.5 To define severe or very 
severe imprecision we will considered if the CI included not only the null effect, but important 
benefits and harms.6 Additionally we will analyse if the total number of patients included in 
the meta-analysis is less than the required number of patients generated by a conventional 
sample size calculation for a single adequately powered trial to define if optimal information

size (OIS) is met.7 We will created GRADE evidence summaries (Summary of Findings tables) 
using the MAGIC Authoring and Publication Platform (www.magicapp.org) to provide user 
friendly formats for clinicians and patients and to allow re-use in the context of clinical 
practice guidelines for COVID-19. We will calculate the absolute risks and RD from the RRs 
(and their CIs) and the mean risk in the control groups across all of the included trials.
